7
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,114
I, Noh Ae-jeong,

8
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:38,741
have three outstanding qualities
you will only grow to love.

9
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41,160
A, five years of delivering newspapers

10
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:44,205
prove my drive and constant diligence.

11
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:48,042
B, four years of working
as a supermarket cashier

12
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:50,545
exhibit how precise and meticulous I am.

13
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:52,255
Enjoy the movie. Hello, sir.

14
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:54,924
-C, I'm one to never give up...
-Please head left.

15
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:56,467
-...on my dreams.
-Enjoy the movie.

16
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:58,136
-Welcome.
-You can knock me down,

17
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:59,887
but I will always get up.

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,057
And that is why I, Noh Ae-jeong,
hope to join Korea's number one

00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,058
film studio Ten Film...

20
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:05,059
Shinyi Media...

21
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:06,811
At Thumb Film's Accounting Department,

22
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:10,398
I will showcase my three traits
and deliver--

23
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:16,487
-I'm sorry, sir.
-We're in the middle of an interview!

24
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:17,780
Take it outside.

25
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:18,906
EPISODE 1

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,451
Seriously?
Have you not heard of silent mode?

27
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:23,077
I apologize.

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,206
Apart from part-time jobs, are you
familiar with any accounting software,

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,752
or programs like Microsoft Excel,
PowerPoint, or Word?

30
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:36,799
I used PowerPoint in university.

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,598
Right. Well, according to your resume,

32
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,059
you apparently dropped out of university.

33
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:49,145
That's right.

34
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:51,105
Dropped out in 2006? Hold on a second.

35
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,315
One, two...

36
00:01:52,398 --> 00:01:55,026
How many years of study did you complete?

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,862
I dropped out
halfway through my senior year.

38
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:59,238
Wait, hold on a second.

39
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,949
You only had a semester left,

40
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,577
so why did you choose to drop out?

41
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,085
Was there some sort of an issue?

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,313
Ha-nee!

43
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:35,274
-Ma'am, you're here.
-Goodness.

44
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:38,402
I apologize for being late.
I couldn't get off work earlier.

45
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:39,654
It's all right.

46
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,989
-It's nothing, but...
-Gosh, thank you.

47
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,283
Ha-nee.

48
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,373
The truth is...

49
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:53,000
MY FAMILY, MOM

50
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:55,378
The kids must've asked
why she didn't draw her dad.

51
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:58,714
It's my fault
for not being attentive enough.

52
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:10,101
MY FAMILY, JEONG-U, DAD, MOM

53
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:14,313
DAD, SISTER, ME, MOM

54
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:17,275
Ha-nee, when your mother gets home,

55
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:19,652
why don't we light up a candle
and make a wish?

56
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:22,530
No?

57
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,657
But it's Christmas Eve.

58
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:27,160
You can wish Santa for something--

59
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:28,286
That's a lie.

60
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:30,663
What do you mean?

61
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,331
Santa doesn't exist.

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,626
Just like my dad.

63
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:41,382
Ha-nee, your dad is up in heaven--

64
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,592
That's a lie.

65
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:45,344
Why is that a lie?

66
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:51,684
Ha-nee,

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,230
let's just say that he died, okay?

68
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:57,732
Why?

69
00:03:58,065 --> 00:03:58,983
Well,

70
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,237
your mom wants to think of it that way.

71
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:04,405
Why?

72
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:06,407
Well...

73
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,577
You see,

74
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:13,915
there are some people
you'd rather wish were dead.

75
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,167
You'll understand when you're older.

76
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,752
Why?

77
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,629
Well...

78
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:26,344
How about your mom and I promise

79
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:28,971
to make up for your dad?

80
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:33,100
What? My goodness.

81
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:06,550
DISCOUNT FOR NEW LOANS

82
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:12,974
Was there some sort of an issue?

83
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,144
-Ms. Noh?
-Sorry?

84
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:18,854
THUMB FILM EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT

85
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:21,774
APPLICANT: NOH AE-JEONG

86
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:24,986
If you have nothing else to say...

87
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,281
I became a mom.

88
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,661
I got pregnant at 23

89
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,163
and had to raise my child alone.

90
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,085
I wasn't able to continue my studies,

91
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,587
but I don't regret any of it.

92
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:48,092
Caring for my daughter wasn't easy,

93
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:52,138
but it was a joy to see her grow up.

94
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,808
She turned six this year.

95
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,894
Oh, I see.

96
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,065
When she was young,
I could get by on part-time jobs.

97
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,277
But she needs to start school soon

98
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:08,446
and I want her to dress in nice clothes.

99
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,824
-That's why I'm looking for stability--
-Right.

100
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,493
I hear you loud and clear.

101
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:16,370
RESUME: NOH AE-JEONG

102
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:36,891
Gosh!

103
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,702
In we go.

104
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:43,124
What's wrong?

105
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,418
What on earth happened?

106
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,670
Mom, no. Stay back.

107
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:49,630
Mom?

108
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:51,632
Ha-nee, stay back. You'll hurt yourself.

109
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:53,968
Mom, keep her there.

110
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,306
I lost my grip and it fell.

111
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:04,145
It's all my fault.

112
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:20,453
It's not your fault.

113
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,413
The cheap cup is to blame.

114
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:35,843
Just a second, Ms. Noh.

115
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:39,221
Why a film studio of all places?

116
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:42,725
Other companies have
accounting departments,

117
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,644
but you applied for a job
at a film studio.

118
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,438
That's what I want to know.

119
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:51,484
It's over now.

120
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,236
Wait there. I'll be right over.

121
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:59,617
YEAR 2006

122
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,160
Because I had a dream.

123
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,956
DIRECTED BY OH DAE-O
PRODUCED BY NOH AE-JEONG

124
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,416
Before I became a mom,

125
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,961
my dream was to become a film producer.

126
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:16,509
That was so cool!

127
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,844
-Congratulations.
-It was awesome.

128
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,471
That was incredible.

129
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:34,735
I can be asked to push pencils
for all I care.

130
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:38,030
Working at a film studio in any capacity
would be enough.

131
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,617
Is that important?
That dream of yours, I mean.

132
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:46,455
I may be barely scraping by,

133
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,458
but that hasn't changed who I am.

134
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:53,504
I promised myself

135
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,298
when I first learned that I was pregnant.

136
00:09:57,258 --> 00:10:01,554
My dream, my life, and my child.
I wasn't going to give up on any of them.

137
00:10:04,723 --> 00:10:06,267
I know it won't be easy.

138
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:07,977
However,

139
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,856
I want to set an example for my child.

140
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,860
I want her to see me achieve my dream.

141
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,446
What is it? Was that from
the company you interviewed for?

142
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,615
Were you hired?

143
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:24,702
Grandma, what does "hired" mean?

144
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,290
The silence is killing me.
Answer my question.

145
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:31,166
Come on.

146
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:32,876
Mom.

147
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:35,045
I'm hired.

148
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:37,881
They hired me.

149
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:40,384
-Really?
-I got in.

150
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:42,720
-My gosh!
-Mom?

151
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,388
-Goodness me.
-What's "hired"?

152
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:48,225
My gosh. Sweetie pie!

153
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:50,060
My adorable little puppy.

154
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:54,273
I can't believe it, Mom.
It's too good to be true!

155
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:56,317
-Goodness.
-Mom?

156
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,735
What a miracle.

157
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:04,700
Have you all made a wish?

158
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,076
All right, then.

159
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,788
Let's see who blows out the candles first.

160
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:13,709
One.

161
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:15,794
Two.

162
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:18,631
Three!

163
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,177
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas.

164
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:25,763
Have a good day.

165
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,223
Gosh, it looks brand new.

166
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:31,477
DRY CLEANING

167
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,479
MR AND MRS DRY CLEANING

168
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:46,325
-Look. Isn't mine adorable?
-I picked that first.

169
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,577
-No, I did.
-Come on. We'll be late for school.

170
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:50,079
Hurry!

171
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,761
Either you watch that or eat.

172
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,388
Stop nibbling and do one or the other.

173
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:10,974
Why leave the TV on
when no one's watching it?

174
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:12,935
Unbelievable.

175
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:15,354
The key to success these days
is multitasking.

176
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:18,649
How about I multitask on you
and smack you front and back?

177
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,696
I'm back!

178
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:27,449
Ta-da. Fresh from the dry cleaner's.

179
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:31,078
So you can start afresh at your new school

180
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:33,163
and keep the momentum going
until you graduate.

181
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:36,333
As if I'd be able to really start afresh

182
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,835
in a second-hand uniform.

183
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,879
That's rich coming from someone
who had to transfer schools

184
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:42,297
only one month into the semester.

185
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,340
Also, know this.

186
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:45,884
This will be the last time
you transfer schools.

187
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,302
Your days of swapping schools

188
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,429
are now long gone.

189
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:51,181
-Fine.
-This is for you.

190
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:57,896
-What's this?
-Your personal sandbag.

191
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,857
Don't get into trouble on your first day

192
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,610
and squeeze this hard
when you want to hit someone.

193
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:05,112
If that doesn't work,

194
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:08,282
get in their faces
and threaten them with words.

195
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:12,202
You call that parenting?

196
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,830
Mom, that hurts.

197
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:20,002
By the way, when will your company
pay your last month's salary?

198
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:23,338
I already told you
that it'll be wired soon.

199
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:26,675
Anyway, a big investor will come by

200
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,260
to hear our presentation today.

201
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,888
Is that why
you stayed up all night working?

202
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:32,264
Who's the director?

203
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:33,974
Bong Joon-ho? Park Chan-wook?

204
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,311
I can't believe you know those names.

205
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:40,647
What else would I expect
from a daughter of a film producer?

206
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,358
Stop changing the subject.

207
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,945
After the last film tanked,

208
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,698
most employees in the company resigned.

209
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:53,869
Who would this investor
even bet his money on?

210
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,746
Who else?

211
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:59,041
The studio's bookkeeper of eight years
who was promoted as a producer.

212
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:01,543
Your daughter, Noh Ae-jeong.

213
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:05,464
How can a bookkeeper
become a film producer?

214
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,634
I may not seem like it,

215
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:11,637
but I was once a promising student
of the film industry.

216
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:15,516
My boss finally noticed my talents.

217
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:19,561
They say that the sparrow near a school
sings the primer.

218
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:24,399
You've worked there for eight years,
so let's hope you learned something too.

219
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:25,984
Right, of course.

220
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:27,986
Wait. What did you just say?

221
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,446
Whatever.

222
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,241
If you don't get paid
at the end of this month too,

223
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:33,784
you should quit your trash job.

224
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:37,579
Mom, please. That would be disloyal of me.

225
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:41,416
Besides, I have a good feeling
about this next project.

226
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:46,839
Does that mean
we won't have to pay rent anymore?

227
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:48,423
The rent?

228
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:52,678
Don't you worry
because I'll buy this darn house.

229
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,222
That's so cool, Mom.

230
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,182
Up top!

231
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:59,309
THUMB FILM

232
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,900
This is odd.
I can't get in touch with him.

233
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,193
Maybe it's our cell reception.

234
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:12,865
Maybe he got lost.

235
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:17,119
It's true that our office
is hard to locate.

236
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:21,081
He's here!

237
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,768
-Goodness. Welcome.
-Hello.

238
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,521
All right then. Hye-jin,
escort them to the conference room.

239
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,273
-It's this way.
-We're--

240
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,277
Over here.

241
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:00,996
Here we go. You've got this.

242
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,085
-Faster.
-Go, go!

243
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:09,421
-Nice.
-All right.

244
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:11,757
Shoot!

245
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:16,136
-Go, go!
-Go, go!

246
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,263
-So young and innocent.
-Go, go!

247
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:28,065
He's not too bad.

248
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,947
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

249
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,949
-Please take this.
-You were awesome.

250
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:38,825
That was incredible.

251
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:40,452
School starts in 90 seconds.

252
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:43,080
Hurry up, everyone.

253
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:45,290
Gosh, you stink of sweat.

254
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,458
Get your butts inside!

255
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,335
RESPECT YOUR TEACHERS

256
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:49,670
Stop right there.

257
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,968
Article 13 Section One
of Hanbak Middle School's rule book.

258
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,136
Students without name tags

259
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,056
will receive penalty points
for bad conduct.

260
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,600
Aren't you aware of that fact?

261
00:17:04,476 --> 00:17:06,019
-I'm not.
-Fine.

262
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,063
Then I'll give you a chance.

263
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:11,525
You have 30 seconds
to clip your name tag in the right place.

264
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:13,527
-I don't have one.
-You don't?

265
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,737
This is my first day
at this school, you see.

266
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:22,619
Did you really think
I'd fall for that palpable lie?

267
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,415
Follow me inside
and find out for yourself.

268
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:28,834
What an attitude...

269
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:32,254
How dare you talk back to a teacher?

270
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,630
Do you want more penalty points?

271
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:36,508
I think she's telling the truth.

272
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:42,889
Get your hands off me.

273
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,517
A new student is joining my class today.

274
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,644
I'm glad I got a smart one.

275
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,441
Are you sure she's one of yours?

276
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:54,234
I think so.

277
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,861
Your name is...

278
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,113
Noh Ha-nee, right?

279
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:00,824
That's right.

280
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:05,287
I'll take her with me then, Mr. Jang.

281
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,749
-Shall we?
-Sure.

282
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,001
Have a good day then.

283
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:16,340
Husband over Flowers,
the new movie of Thumb Film,

284
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,470
follows a woman
who's been single for 14 years

285
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:24,264
as she miraculously finds love.

286
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:28,685
The award-winning Director Kim Sang-ho

287
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:31,146
will showcase his style and vision.

288
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:33,315
That combined with

289
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:37,736
the fresh love story
will hopefully draw in the audience...

290
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,404
The...

291
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:42,199
audience.

292
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,706
The cost of production

293
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:56,046
will be 6.6 billion won.

294
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:59,216
With the costs
for marketing and advertising--

295
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,677
We estimate ten billion won in total.

296
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,222
Right.

297
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,181
How do you expect to

298
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:08,266
raise all that money?

299
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:16,817
We hope for you, the investor,
to invest in our movie.

300
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,406
That's a shame. It seems like
there's some kind of misunderstanding.

301
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:25,575
A misunderstanding?

302
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:32,707
Thank you.

303
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,001
"Nine Capital"?

304
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,214
Wait, a money lending company?

305
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,051
Why are you here at our studio though?

306
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:47,681
You boss at Thumb Film
borrowed 700 million won from us.

307
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:50,392
-What? 700 million?
-700 million won?

308
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,978
That's right, and just so you know,

309
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:56,273
the principal and interest combined
is 1.05 billion won.

310
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:58,733
1.05 billion won? Holy shit.

311
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:01,736
Hye-jin, call the boss.

312
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,656
-His phone is turned off.
-What?

313
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:08,034
As you can see, Mr. Wang is unreachable.

314
00:20:08,118 --> 00:20:11,538
So you, Ms. Noh, must pay back his debt.

315
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:12,706
Me?

316
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:14,499
What? Why?

317
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,751
Why me? Why must I pay it back?

318
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:18,753
-I--
-Because you...

319
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:21,339
stood surety for him.

320
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,349
What is this?

321
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,435
What the hell is this?

322
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:35,061
JOINT SURETY AGREEMENT

323
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:42,444
You're no longer our bookkeeper.

324
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:44,905
You're now Noh Ae-jeong the producer.

325
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:50,827
Produce a movie of your own
and make a name for yourself.

326
00:20:51,578 --> 00:20:53,622
No. No, don't!

327
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:55,457
Don't sign it.

328
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,460
Quit paying rents and buy your own house.

329
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:02,839
NOH AE-JEONG

330
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:09,971
That's it, Producer Noh.

331
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,813
JOINT SURETY AGREEMENT

332
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:21,691
Hold on, sir. Wait!

333
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:24,027
My boss wouldn't have done this to me.

334
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,698
I only thought I was signing off
an investment of 70 million won.

335
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:32,953
How can it go from 70 million
to over a billion won?

336
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:36,248
Sir, please. Please forgive me this once.

337
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,501
Ms. Noh!

338
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:43,630
Sir, wait. Please!

339
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:48,969
Choi Hyang-ja, born July 5, 1960.

340
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:51,096
A body scrub master.

341
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:54,182
She's your mother, am I right?

342
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:57,852
What the hell is this?

343
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:01,648
Noh Ha-nee, born February 15, 2007.

344
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,651
Transferred to Hanbak Middle School
due to personal reasons.

345
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:07,737
She's your daughter, am I right?

346
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:12,117
Are you serious right now?

347
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,119
You have two weeks to pay back the debt.

348
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:17,789
If you aren't able to pay by then,

349
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,961
unpleasant things
might happen to those around you.

350
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:24,879
Don't forget that.

351
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:41,980
Ms. Noh, are you all right?

352
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,488
Are you sure about that?

353
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:51,614
And you?

354
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,658
I made
the Statue of Liberated French Fries.

355
00:22:56,036 --> 00:22:59,748
Kids are pretty much the same
whichever school they go to.

356
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:03,084
Hold on. Right, got it.

357
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,052
Bullseye.

358
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,262
-Did you see that?
-Nice!

359
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,015
-Nice one.
-Good shot.

360
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:22,187
Sorry about that, new girl.
I bet I startled you.

361
00:23:24,022 --> 00:23:26,441
What should we try next?

362
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:52,634
Mr. Wang!

363
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:56,388
Ms. Noh, isn't this breaking and entering?

364
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:57,847
Where is the bastard?

365
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:00,225
-What on earth is this?
-Where is he?

366
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:02,352
Rat bastard.

367
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:04,354
Did he really run off?

368
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:06,356
-He was already sued.
-What?

369
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:08,691
Let me see.

370
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,819
Gosh, it stinks.

371
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,613
LIFE IS DO OR DIE

372
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:21,037
Ms. Noh, isn't this a contract?

373
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:22,872
PUBLICATION RIGHT OF LOVE IS NONEXISTENT

374
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:24,416
"Love Is Nonexistent"?

375
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:29,087
Jeez, this is really old.

376
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,797
The terms aren't even fair.

377
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:38,012
He left behind stupid trash, that bastard!

378
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:40,723
Tell me about it.
It must've been worthless

379
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:43,518
for it to have been stuck under the pot.

380
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:48,982
You fucking bastard.

381
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:54,529
I ought to...

382
00:24:55,572 --> 00:24:58,032
Fuck...

383
00:24:58,116 --> 00:24:59,909
You shitty little jackass!

384
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:12,046
Please calm down.

385
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,215
Gosh!

386
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,343
Really?

387
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,137
Hello?

388
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:23,475
Yes. Ha-nee?

389
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:26,686
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT

390
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,354
STUDENT NAME NOH HA-NEE

391
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:32,233
MOTHER NAME NOH AE-JEONG

392
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,863
Hello, I'm Noh Ha-nee's mother.

393
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:39,699
Where is the counseling office?

394
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:41,993
It's at the end of the hallway
on the second floor.

395
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:44,996
End of the hall, second floor?

396
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,164
Thank you.

397
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,626
Excuse me, Ms. Noh!

398
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,169
Ha-nee!

399
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:54,297
Ha-nee!

400
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:56,424
Ha-nee.

401
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:02,972
This is Ha-nee's mother.

402
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:07,352
Yes, I'm Ha-nee's mother.

403
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:10,939
Look.

404
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:15,485
This is what your daughter did
to my son's face.

405
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:16,819
I'm so upset.

406
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:20,031
I'm sorry.

407
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:21,366
I'm really sorry.

408
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:23,326
It's my fault.

409
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:25,828
-Ma'am, I'm sorry.
-Mom.

410
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:29,499
Come here. Come here and apologize.

411
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,501
-Quickly.
-I don't want her apology.

412
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:33,628
I want to hold
a School Violence Committee meeting.

413
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:36,673
Sir.

414
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:39,759
A School Violence Committee
meeting can hurt all the students.

415
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:40,843
Mr. Oh.

416
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:44,222
Are you playing dumb
because it's not your student

417
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:45,557
who got the nosebleed?

418
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,350
Mr. Jang, that's not--

419
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:52,146
Anyway, we'll see if the meeting
will hurt the kids or not when we hold--

420
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,235
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I apologize.

421
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:59,654
-Please forgive--
-Let go. What are you doing?

422
00:26:59,737 --> 00:27:02,073
-I'm sorry.
-I don't need to hear it anymore.

423
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:04,200
Let's have men settle this.

424
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:06,703
Where is her dad?

425
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,331
I don't have a dad.

426
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:17,463
I have no such thing as a dad,

427
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,633
so if you have something to say,
just say it to me.

428
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,763
-Ha-nee.
-I knew it.

429
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:29,058
There was a reason why she was

430
00:27:29,142 --> 00:27:31,436
-so ill-behaved.
-Honey, stop.

431
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:33,313
Ms. Noh.

432
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:37,066
Let me give you an advice
as a fellow parent.

433
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:41,070
Children from single-parent families
should be raised more strictly.

434
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:43,448
If you pity them and indulge them,

435
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:47,744
it shows that they have no dad.

436
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:52,415
Sir.

437
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:55,752
Don't you think
what you just said is unacceptable?

438
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,171
She...

439
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:02,091
has a dad.

440
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:07,972
I'm her dad and her mom.

441
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:13,645
My kid has never once

442
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:18,191
been raised with only half the love.

443
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:28,701
You can charge me for the hospital bill.

444
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,954
I'll fully compensate your son
for the pain he suffered.

445
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,790
But...

446
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:42,048
how will you compensate

447
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,550
for my child's heartache?

448
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:57,146
I'm sorry for all the commotion, Mr. Oh.

449
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,107
Excuse us. Let's go.

450
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:02,151
Ms. Noh.

451
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:05,613
-Ms. Noh.
-I'll see them off.

452
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:09,367
Please don't mind them.

453
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,998
Mom, I really didn't do anything wrong.

454
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:18,418
I didn't hit him. He first...

455
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:23,297
Mom?

456
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:26,509
-Mom, are you listening?
-Noh Ha-nee.

457
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,970
Transferred to Hanbak Middle School
due to personal reasons.

458
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,472
Let's go. We have to go.

459
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:33,516
-What's wrong? Where are we going?
-Let's go.

460
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,351
Mom, let go of my arm.

461
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,938
Mom, do you really think it was my fault?

462
00:29:39,188 --> 00:29:40,565
Be quiet, Ha-nee.

463
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:45,194
Ha-nee, let's go home and talk, okay?

464
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:46,446
Let's go home.

465
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,575
Ha-nee! What are you doing?

466
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,326
Hey.

467
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:57,206
Why won't you listen to me?

468
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,333
Ha-nee.

469
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,838
Before you say sorry,
before you apologize,

470
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:06,090
shouldn't you listen to me first?

471
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:12,513
I asked you already.

472
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:16,184
I asked you not to get into trouble
on the first day of school.

473
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:19,145
Never mind. I don't want to hear it.

474
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:23,524
How long do I have to live
with my heart in my mouth because of you?

475
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,404
Whose fault is that?

476
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:32,742
What?

477
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:35,536
It's your fault!

478
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:38,664
If you hadn't given birth to me,

479
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:41,876
you and I didn't have to be treated
like shit!

480
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:47,882
This is useless!

481
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:52,136
No matter what I do,

482
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:55,431
the fact that I don't have a dad
doesn't change.

483
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,085
That kid, Han Chan-yeong

484
00:31:25,545 --> 00:31:27,630
deserves a nosebleed.

485
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,342
He always bullies me.

486
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:34,720
Today Ha-nee taught him a lesson.

487
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:38,683
Nobody has ever stood up for me.

488
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,686
Ha-nee was the only one who helped me.

489
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,856
Ha-nee didn't do anything wrong.

490
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,217
How much did that CEO bastard
scam you for?

491
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,094
About ten?

492
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:23,227
It's ten billion won.

493
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:26,188
What a bastard.

494
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:34,280
I realized that you shouldn't call
something the worst so recklessly.

495
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:38,367
Because that might not be the worst.

496
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:45,166
Drink up.

497
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:51,547
I'm buying this for the most
miserable person on Earth today.

498
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:01,224
Sook-hee.

499
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:04,936
Why do bad things always happen
all at once?

500
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,355
I'm not sure.

501
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:11,984
Since they all came at once,
they'll probably leave all at once.

502
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,238
No.

503
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:17,240
They won't.

504
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,409
Because they didn't 14 years ago.

505
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:29,418
Would it have been different
if I hadn't met him then?

506
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:35,299
If you pity them and indulge them,

507
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:37,260
it shows that they have

508
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,011
no dad.

509
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:46,644
Bullocks. It doesn't at all.

510
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:48,688
I look perfect.

511
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:52,650
-Mom! I'm home.
-Yes.

512
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:54,777
Here.

513
00:33:57,196 --> 00:33:59,490
-What? Did you drink?
-A little.

514
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:01,409
Eat this.

515
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,787
Where's Ha-nee? Is she in her room?

516
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,108
I'm her dad

517
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:17,360
and her mom.

518
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,415
Sir, wait!

519
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:34,210
Stop. Please wait.

520
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:35,878
I'm sorry.

521
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:37,004
Sir!

522
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,674
Thank you.

523
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,135
I'm so tired. Thank you.

524
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:48,390
-Thank you.
-I almost missed it.

525
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,728
Goodness.

526
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:55,898
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:58,442 --> 00:35:59,443
Oh, no.

528
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:01,487
It's creased.

529
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,030
It must be something important.

530
00:36:03,114 --> 00:36:06,992
Yes, I've lost days of sleep
to write this proposal.

531
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:08,369
What am I going to do?

532
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,996
Anyway, thank you.

533
00:36:15,543 --> 00:36:16,919
Hello.

534
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:18,003
Hello.

535
00:36:18,629 --> 00:36:20,798
You're Ha-nee's homeroom teacher, right?

536
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,008
Good to see you.

537
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:31,767
Sorry.

538
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:35,646
I'm sorry. That was my mistake.

539
00:36:36,397 --> 00:36:38,232
I guess you still don't recognize me.

540
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:42,153
Pardon?

541
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:45,364
Long time no see, Ae-jeong.

542
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:24,320
Ae-jeong, open the window.

543
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:26,197
Open the window?

544
00:37:34,705 --> 00:37:35,956
I missed you.

545
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,379
Don't worry about Ha-nee.
I'll take good care of her.

546
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:43,881
Okay.

547
00:37:44,423 --> 00:37:47,134
Goodbye. Go on.

548
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,930
Ae-jeong! See you again.

549
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,431
I'll call you!

550
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:07,112
Why of all people is he Ha-nee's
homeroom teacher?

551
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:11,742
This is driving me nuts!

552
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,763
Yes, Ha-nee.

553
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:35,224
You look happy.

554
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:36,350
What?

555
00:38:37,643 --> 00:38:38,936
Well...

556
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:40,396
Here.

557
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:43,607
Thank you for trusting me yesterday.

558
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:49,280
Goodbye.

559
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:51,949
Ha-nee.

560
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:00,457
If you're having a hard time,

561
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,459
tell me, all right?

562
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:07,965
Thanks for this.

563
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:09,091
Okay.

564
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:14,888
Thank you.

565
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:30,154
HUSBAND OVER FLOWERS

566
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:37,161
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry.

567
00:39:51,008 --> 00:39:52,134
Hello, sir.

568
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:54,511
I'm Producer Noh Ae-jeong of Thumb Film.

569
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:57,222
I requested an investment meeting
last time.

570
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:59,099
I heard Thumb Film went bankrupt.

571
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:00,476
No, it didn't.

572
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,687
The company isn't in a good situation,
but we're working on something.

573
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:06,565
Once you read it, you'll see that
the script is very solid.

574
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:09,234
I heard another company
was working on this.

575
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:13,447
No, our company signed a contract
a long time ago.

576
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,658
No, this was sold to a different company.

577
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:22,706
Let me tell you this so you don't go to
another company and get humiliated.

578
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,168
There's no company that would invest
in Thumb Films in this industry.

579
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:28,128
Sir.

580
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:30,464
This is Producer Noh Ae-jeong
of Thumb Film.

581
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:34,635
Ms. Noh, are you really doing this?

582
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:39,014
Sir, I heard some strange news.

583
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:43,435
There's a ridiculous rumor going around
that you're working with another company.

584
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,313
People in this industry spread gossip
so recklessly, don't they?

585
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:47,356
I'm sorry, Producer Noh.

586
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:49,149
I heard Mr. Wang fled.

587
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:51,652
He breached the contract first.

588
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:54,279
-What?
-It worked out for the better.

589
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:58,450
Thumb Film didn't even have
the ability to produce my work anyway.

590
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:02,663
I'm still here.

591
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:05,124
Sign a contract with me again.

592
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:06,667
You know me.

593
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,921
Since I first met you,
I've been working really hard.

594
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:14,216
I'll do my best to make your work

595
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,260
-see the light--
-You should give up.

596
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:17,803
Please, sir.

597
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:25,102
Producer Noh.

598
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:27,354
This is your first film, right?

599
00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:31,275
Let's be frank. Can you bring in the money

600
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,027
and hire all the actors I want
for this film?

601
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:38,699
Well...

602
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:41,118
I know you've been working really hard
for several months,

603
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:42,744
but you don't have the ability

604
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:44,204
to produce my work.

605
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:02,139
THUMB FILM

606
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:06,477
SUMMER IN LOVE

607
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:18,572
CEO of Thumb Film.

608
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:25,078
CEO WANG SEONG GYU

609
00:42:27,998 --> 00:42:29,166
Ms. Noh.

610
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,919
Did something happen?

611
00:42:33,504 --> 00:42:34,922
No, nothing.

612
00:42:36,673 --> 00:42:39,551
Let's sell whatever we can here.

613
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:44,223
I'll pay your salary with that money.

614
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,310
But you need the money more than I do.

615
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,854
I'm okay.

616
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,484
For the time being,

617
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:00,322
I decided to focus on
what to do with the bastard.

618
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:01,865
Pardon?

619
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:04,117
Just you wait.

620
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:07,871
I'll grab his neck and throw him down
on asphalt.

621
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:10,040
I'll punch his face

622
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,669
and beat him to a pulp
until all his teeth fall out.

623
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:15,671
Are you okay?

624
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:16,964
Goodness.

625
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:18,340
-It's bleeding.
-Goodness.

626
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:20,259
Gosh.

627
00:43:20,342 --> 00:43:22,427
Throw this out.

628
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:23,637
Okay.

629
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:28,850
Goodness.

630
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:31,895
This is a really old
handwritten manuscript.

631
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,232
I don't care if it's handwritten or not.

632
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:37,234
Burn it all!

633
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,153
Okay.

634
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:48,287
But...

635
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:49,913
this was written by

636
00:43:50,622 --> 00:43:52,374
the author Cheon Eok-man.

637
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:06,138
Cheon Eok-man.

638
00:44:06,972 --> 00:44:10,267
-This is really old.
-He left behind stupid trash!

639
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:15,063
LOVE IS NONEXISTENT

640
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:17,024
"Love Is Nonexistent."

641
00:44:17,608 --> 00:44:18,900
What?

642
00:44:18,984 --> 00:44:19,860
What's this?

643
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,445
Hye-jin.

644
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,072
-A wet wipe
-A wet wipe.

645
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:25,240
A wet wipe.

646
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:53,018
Easy now.

647
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,104
Cheon Eok...

648
00:44:57,856 --> 00:44:59,816
CHEON EOK-MAN

649
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:03,779
No way. This copyright contract...

650
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:07,449
It's signed by the best-selling author,
Cheon Eok-man!

651
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:09,409
Goodness!

652
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:13,330
-We did it! We're saved!
-Yes!

653
00:45:13,497 --> 00:45:15,957
We did it!

654
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:21,380
This place is unbelievable.

655
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:24,591
He must be loaded
since he owns a loan company.

656
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:25,634
There's a grass lawn!

657
00:45:27,636 --> 00:45:28,762
The house is beautiful.

658
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:30,430
It's really big.

659
00:45:44,194 --> 00:45:45,654
Ms. Noh.

660
00:45:45,737 --> 00:45:46,822
Yes?

661
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:56,957
Run!

662
00:46:10,053 --> 00:46:11,096
Stay back!

663
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:13,640
Get back!

664
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:18,437
Get back!

665
00:46:21,022 --> 00:46:22,858
Go away!

666
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:50,177
I was told

667
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:52,804
that you wanted to tell me something.

668
00:46:54,598 --> 00:46:55,599
Well...

669
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:58,143
Actually...

670
00:46:58,226 --> 00:46:59,519
Please have a seat.

671
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:07,235
Let's go.

672
00:47:09,905 --> 00:47:11,782
Well, actually...

673
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:15,660
I would like to

674
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:18,163
do business with you.

675
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:22,292
Business?

676
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,845
This is the copyright contract
of Writer Cheon Eok-man,

677
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:37,182
the number one author
that investors want to invest in in 2020.

678
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:48,026
If I make a movie with that,
I can attract over ten million viewers,

679
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:51,404
and repay the loan of one billion won
in a lump sum with the proceeds.

680
00:47:54,324 --> 00:47:55,534
I'm not sure.

681
00:47:56,034 --> 00:47:57,786
Who would invest in a film company

682
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:00,455
that was abandoned by its CEO?

683
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:06,670
There's no company that would invest
in Thumb Films in this industry.

684
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,464
You don't have the ability
to produce my work.

685
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,258
Even if you have the copyright,

686
00:48:11,341 --> 00:48:13,677
who would trust you

687
00:48:14,302 --> 00:48:15,512
and make an investment?

688
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:18,890
I believe we're both busy.

689
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:21,184
So you better leave.

690
00:48:24,896 --> 00:48:25,981
Then

691
00:48:31,528 --> 00:48:33,196
why don't you make that investment?

692
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:35,740
Ms. Noh.

693
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:10,483
I...

694
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,486
only invest in people I can trust.

695
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:16,740
If it's worth money,

696
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,617
I trust people

697
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:21,494
and invest as much as I want.

698
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:24,164
I would even risk my life.

699
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:25,790
If you give me a chance,

700
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,336
I'll prove that I, Noh Ae-jeong,

701
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:33,006
am capable as a producer.

702
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:36,009
Please stop.

703
00:49:39,596 --> 00:49:43,683
Do you mean that you are willing
to risk your life

704
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:45,894
for this investment?

705
00:49:47,938 --> 00:49:49,439
I'm confident.

706
00:49:50,065 --> 00:49:51,274
Because my life

707
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:54,069
is in the hands of my family.

708
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:04,371
Fine. I'll give you an opportunity.

709
00:50:05,538 --> 00:50:06,539
-An--
-An--

710
00:50:06,706 --> 00:50:07,958
-An opportunity?
-An opportunity?

711
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:08,917
An opportunity?

712
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:13,922
First, I need someone
to write the scenario.

713
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:18,176
Cheon Eok-man, the original author,
should do it.

714
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:20,553
-What?
-What?

715
00:50:20,637 --> 00:50:21,930
Cheon Eok-man?

716
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:24,599
And as for the actor...

717
00:50:25,642 --> 00:50:27,060
ACTOR RYU JIN DEBUTS IN HOLLYWOOD?

718
00:50:28,186 --> 00:50:29,354
How about Ryu Jin?

719
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:33,358
You see, I'm a fan of his.

720
00:50:35,694 --> 00:50:36,861
Ryu Jin?

721
00:50:36,945 --> 00:50:39,948
Are you talking about that celebrity
who'll be debuting in Hollywood?

722
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,451
Does it have to be him?

723
00:50:43,535 --> 00:50:45,328
There are many actors in Korea.

724
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:48,164
Like I said, Ryu Jin will be the actor,
and Cheon Eok-man, the writer.

725
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:51,001
If you succeed,
not only will I settle your debt,

726
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:54,004
but I'll also invest in the movie myself.

727
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,007
Ten billion won.

728
00:50:58,842 --> 00:51:00,135
Ten billion won?

729
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:03,847
LETTER OF INTENT

730
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,432
You have eight days.

731
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:07,350
If you fail to keep your promise,

732
00:51:07,684 --> 00:51:09,477
you should be prepared.

733
00:51:39,424 --> 00:51:43,053
Tell him never to look for me again

734
00:51:43,428 --> 00:51:47,557
and that the next time I see him,

735
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,022
I'll have his head.

736
00:51:55,356 --> 00:51:56,941
-Over here.
-Pose for the camera.

737
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:59,110
-This way.
-Please look here.

738
00:51:59,194 --> 00:52:00,820
-Hello.
-This way, please.

739
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:02,572
Okay, thank you.

740
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:03,656
Please pose.

741
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,950
-Please look this way.
-Please strike a pose.

742
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:07,494
Okay, thank you.

743
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:09,037
-Hey, Hye-jin.
-Ms. Noh.

744
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,997
I've almost arrived at Mr. Cheon's house.

745
00:52:11,164 --> 00:52:12,832
How's it going over there?

746
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,502
It doesn't look easy,

747
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:16,878
but I'll have to make it work.

748
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:18,922
You said you guys knew each other.

749
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:21,508
I'm sure he won't ignore you.

750
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:23,218
Right.

751
00:52:24,928 --> 00:52:27,097
We did have a special relationship.

752
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,223
Please pose for the camera.

753
00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:29,891
Okay, thank you.

754
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:30,975
Jin.

755
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:32,685
Jin.

756
00:52:33,895 --> 00:52:34,771
Well...

757
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:37,065
Let's kiss.

758
00:52:49,577 --> 00:52:51,579
HELLO, DAN-BI
IN THEATRES APRIL 20

759
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:53,665
Not too long ago,
you were invited to Hollywood

760
00:52:53,748 --> 00:52:55,500
and came back to Korea this morning.

761
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:57,752
Have you brought back some good news?

762
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:00,046
I'm just doing my best at all times.

763
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:06,344
Did you meet with Director James Caramel?

764
00:53:08,012 --> 00:53:11,808
He's a big fan of Korean cuisine.

765
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:14,894
Does this mean
you're set to debut in Hollywood?

766
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:19,315
I think around next week, I'll be with
James under the Californian sun

767
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,484
with a glass of mojito in my hand.

768
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,278
Who's the co-star?

769
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:24,612
No comments on that.

770
00:53:25,864 --> 00:53:27,657
Since many people
have been waiting for me,

771
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,285
I'll make sure to hold
a press conference soon.

772
00:53:30,368 --> 00:53:32,453
I look forward to today's movie,

773
00:53:32,537 --> 00:53:34,998
and I hope many of you will check it out.
Thank you.

774
00:53:43,923 --> 00:53:45,675
Jin!

775
00:53:46,926 --> 00:53:47,844
Jin!

776
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:49,345
Jin!

777
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:50,722
Jin!

778
00:53:50,805 --> 00:53:54,350
Jin, don't go to Hollywood. Stay with me.

779
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:55,727
Wait!

780
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:58,229
-Wait a minute!
-Jin!

781
00:53:58,354 --> 00:53:59,898
-Move aside! No photos!
-Jin!

782
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:02,567
Jin! Hold on!

783
00:54:03,568 --> 00:54:06,029
RYU JIN'S DIEHARD FAN BARGES IN
DURING A MOVIE PREVIEW

784
00:54:10,158 --> 00:54:12,660
So you couldn't meet him?

785
00:54:13,661 --> 00:54:14,871
I'm going to try again.

786
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:17,457
I'm going to visit his agency

787
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,125
or even his house.

788
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:22,587
Good. You said you guys had
a special relationship.

789
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:24,339
You will find another opportunity.

790
00:54:26,216 --> 00:54:27,383
Special?

791
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:28,801
Yes.

792
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:31,304
We were almost special.

793
00:54:33,223 --> 00:54:36,893
-Noh Ae-jeong!
-Noh Ae-jeong!

794
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:40,730
-Noh Ae-jeong!
-Noh Ae-jeong!

795
00:54:40,813 --> 00:54:43,566
-No.
-Just drink it!

796
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,734
You said you would!

797
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:47,153
No. Just give me the penalty.

798
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:50,448
-Writing her name with her butt!
-No!

799
00:54:51,074 --> 00:54:53,493
Seeing how much alcohol is left,

800
00:54:53,576 --> 00:54:56,120
she should kiss someone to make up for it.

801
00:54:56,204 --> 00:54:57,830
You're right!

802
00:54:57,956 --> 00:54:59,207
No way!

803
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:02,460
-Lucky you.
-Come on.

804
00:55:02,543 --> 00:55:04,254
-With whom?
-Me, of course.

805
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:07,173
No, not you.

806
00:55:07,257 --> 00:55:08,633
I...

807
00:55:09,801 --> 00:55:11,928
will pick

808
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:13,471
whom to kiss!

809
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:16,057
-What?
-Come on.

810
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:20,186
Here I go.

811
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,562
-All right, let's go.
-Ae-jeong.

812
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:23,648
-Let's go.
-Ae-jeong.

813
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:25,525
-Let's hurry.
-Wait up!

814
00:55:25,608 --> 00:55:27,110
-Hey!
-Wait!

815
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:28,194
I'm curious to find out.

816
00:55:28,278 --> 00:55:29,904
Wait for me!

817
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:30,989
Open up!

818
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:37,328
Let's go.

819
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:39,580
-Hurry up.
-Hey!

820
00:55:39,664 --> 00:55:40,957
-What?
-Look at her!

821
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:44,252
Jin.

822
00:55:45,628 --> 00:55:46,504
Jin.

823
00:55:47,797 --> 00:55:48,840
Well...

824
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:51,175
You see...

825
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:57,682
So...

826
00:56:01,144 --> 00:56:02,145
Let's kiss.

827
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:18,578
No!

828
00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:35,011
What is that?

829
00:56:38,973 --> 00:56:40,016
That's disgusting!

830
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:44,604
Ae-jeong, what about we go somewhere else?

831
00:56:48,316 --> 00:56:49,400
My shoes.

832
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,737
My shoes!

833
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,863
My shoes!

834
00:56:55,156 --> 00:56:56,783
My shoes...

835
00:56:59,744 --> 00:57:01,245
My shoes!

836
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:04,374
Hey!

837
00:57:09,754 --> 00:57:11,047
What?

838
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:14,842
We're no match for Hollywood.

839
00:57:16,344 --> 00:57:17,887
Don't be ridiculous.

840
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:22,475
We have the almighty Cheon Eok-man.

841
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:24,102
I'm not sure about that.

842
00:57:24,602 --> 00:57:26,020
I can't seem to reach him.

843
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:29,816
What? You can't reach him?

844
00:57:35,238 --> 00:57:36,239
Jin!

845
00:57:36,531 --> 00:57:39,033
Jin!

846
00:57:40,785 --> 00:57:43,871
Jin! I got some ointment. Let me see.

847
00:57:44,747 --> 00:57:46,207
Oh, come on. I'm fine.

848
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,708
Not at all.

849
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:50,044
She should've collapsed
on top of me instead.

850
00:57:50,128 --> 00:57:51,337
What if the wound scars?

851
00:57:55,925 --> 00:57:56,926
Hey.

852
00:57:57,593 --> 00:57:59,053
I'm really fine.

853
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:04,434
Rather, I'm happy.

854
00:58:05,726 --> 00:58:10,064
I witnessed a fan who loved me so much
that she'd pounce on me.

855
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,901
Jin.

856
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:17,864
Oftentimes, I'm so proud
to be your manager. No.

857
00:58:18,865 --> 00:58:20,616
I'm so proud to be your close friend.

858
00:58:23,244 --> 00:58:26,205
It doesn't matter how much
this world changes.

859
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,375
Once a brother, always a brother.

860
00:58:30,585 --> 00:58:31,586
Got that?

861
00:58:32,044 --> 00:58:33,254
Jin!

862
00:58:35,214 --> 00:58:37,091
How on earth did a fan
barge at him like that?

863
00:58:37,258 --> 00:58:38,718
How could you let Jin fall down?

864
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:40,094
I'm sorry, ma'am.

865
00:58:41,053 --> 00:58:42,138
Ms. Song.

866
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:46,768
I'm sorry I got worked up.

867
00:58:46,934 --> 00:58:50,062
I was worried that you were badly injured.

868
00:58:50,897 --> 00:58:54,776
Anyway, good work on the audition
and the film preview.

869
00:58:54,859 --> 00:58:57,069
While we wait for James Caramel
to call back,

870
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:59,530
how about we have a party
to celebrate your return?

871
00:59:01,657 --> 00:59:04,160
-I've reserved a place.
-You can have the party without me.

872
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:07,622
I have a previous engagement.

873
00:59:07,705 --> 00:59:08,873
With whom?

874
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:11,167
No one told me about this.

875
00:59:14,754 --> 00:59:15,963
With Kwae-nam.

876
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:20,635
Let's go grab a drink,

877
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,053
Kwae-nam.

878
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:25,097
Okay.

879
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:28,893
I should take the ointment.

880
00:59:32,897 --> 00:59:33,940
Jin.

881
00:59:36,818 --> 00:59:38,277
THIS IS NOH AE-JEONG FROM THUMB FILM

882
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,863
HELLO, MR. CHEON EOK-MAN

883
00:59:43,783 --> 00:59:45,243
I AM WRITING TO YOU BECAUSE

884
00:59:54,836 --> 00:59:57,171
WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOVIE
WITH A SCRIPT YOU WROTE

885
01:00:01,676 --> 01:00:03,886
SINCERELY, NOH AE-JEONG FROM THUMB FILM

886
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:08,808
Please.

887
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,519
I beg you, Mr. Cheon.

888
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,357
Please take a look at my email.

889
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:20,486
My future is in your hands.

890
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,571
Please.

891
01:00:25,616 --> 01:00:28,035
To all the gods out there,

892
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:31,581
please help me out this once. Please.

893
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,500
YOUR MAIL HAS BEEN SENT

894
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,510
ANNUAL SPRING LITERARY CONTEST

895
01:00:47,513 --> 01:00:50,850
How great is he
that everyone loves him so much?

896
01:00:55,563 --> 01:00:56,981
Let's take a look.

897
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:03,237
"Love Is Nonexistent."

898
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:11,245
SHE VANISHED. SHE LEFT ME OUT OF THE BLUE

899
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,874
"When it was announced that
the wish of the winner will be granted,

900
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,294
I swung the sword with all my might

901
01:01:18,377 --> 01:01:21,005
with the thought that I could finally
tell her how I felt."

902
01:01:30,014 --> 01:01:32,308
"As I held her hand for the first time

903
01:01:33,976 --> 01:01:39,690
and as our eyes met,
I felt as if I was drifting away."

904
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:12,598
Do not hold the sword in your left hand.

905
01:02:13,683 --> 01:02:15,518
Your left hand is close to your heart,

906
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:18,187
so it will only endanger you
when you wield the sword.

907
01:02:18,688 --> 01:02:20,147
So that was why.

908
01:02:22,024 --> 01:02:23,234
That was why

909
01:02:24,819 --> 01:02:26,237
my sword swayed in front of you.

910
01:02:28,197 --> 01:02:30,491
"Even until then, I had no idea

911
01:02:30,574 --> 01:02:34,578
that the woman I loved wanted to kill me."

912
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:37,873
No way.

913
01:02:38,457 --> 01:02:41,544
Does that mean she betrayed him?

914
01:02:44,755 --> 01:02:46,382
It's a historical piece,

915
01:02:47,299 --> 01:02:49,593
and it's also melodramatic
and action-packed.

916
01:02:50,302 --> 01:02:52,179
This really is something.

917
01:03:25,004 --> 01:03:28,299
THIS IS CHEON EOK-MAN.
IF YOU'RE FREE, I'D LIKE TO MEET YOU

918
01:03:28,382 --> 01:03:31,761
AT MARAGON CITY HOTEL'S COFFEE SHOP
AT 1 P.M. TODAY.

919
01:03:32,178 --> 01:03:33,637
He replied.

920
01:03:35,556 --> 01:03:38,100
Mom!

921
01:03:38,184 --> 01:03:41,437
-Mom!
-My goodness, what's wrong?

922
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,856
Mom, Cheon Eok-man replied back.

923
01:03:43,939 --> 01:03:46,942
He replied!

924
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:49,945
Cheon Eok-man!

925
01:03:52,031 --> 01:03:53,866
Grandma, what's wrong with her?

926
01:03:55,367 --> 01:03:57,536
-I have no idea.
-Cheon Eok-man!

927
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,038
Who is Cheon Eok-man?

928
01:03:59,121 --> 01:04:00,498
Cheon Eok-man!

929
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:04,251
He wanted to see me immediately.

930
01:04:04,335 --> 01:04:06,670
He wrote it before he became famous,
so it's special to him.

931
01:04:06,754 --> 01:04:10,424
No way! I think we've hit the jackpot!

932
01:04:10,508 --> 01:04:11,842
Calm down and be patient.

933
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:13,594
I'm going to persuade him no matter what.

934
01:04:13,677 --> 01:04:15,012
-Okay!
-Bye.

935
01:04:27,399 --> 01:04:28,400
Hello?

936
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,903
Yes, I'm on the 26th floor.

937
01:04:31,028 --> 01:04:32,029
Hello?

938
01:04:33,114 --> 01:04:34,114
Yes.

939
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:35,908
Okay.

940
01:04:37,493 --> 01:04:39,495
WRITER CHEON EOK-MAN

941
01:05:12,611 --> 01:05:14,238
Is this Producer Noh Ae-jeong?

942
01:05:17,658 --> 01:05:18,659
What?

943
01:05:19,493 --> 01:05:20,327
Hello?

944
01:05:40,472 --> 01:05:42,975
A DIEHARD FAN BARGES IN

945
01:06:04,038 --> 01:06:06,165
THINKING OF YOU WAS WHAT I DID ALL MY LIFE

946
01:06:11,545 --> 01:06:16,050
TO AE-JEONG

947
01:06:31,065 --> 01:06:32,107
Hello.

948
01:06:32,816 --> 01:06:33,901
I'm Cheon Eok-man.

951
01:07:03,973 --> 01:07:06,892
You used to know the writer Cheon Eok-man?

952
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:10,521
How does it feel to meet me again
in 14 years?

953
01:07:10,604 --> 01:07:14,858
Why do I need that sick bastard's help?

954
01:07:14,942 --> 01:07:16,735
So you've failed your mission.

955
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:18,195
No!

956
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:19,238
You've changed a lot.

957
01:07:20,197 --> 01:07:22,908
How could I forget you, Ae-jeong?

958
01:07:22,992 --> 01:07:25,160
I waited and waited for her back then.

959
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:28,747
I've missed you a lot.

960
01:07:28,956 --> 01:07:33,210
Will the sun ever shine
for someone like me?

961
