3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.050
It looks like you're using Saet-byul
to get over your ex-girlfriend.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.490
And that makes me feel uncomfortable.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.860
What?

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.720
If you're not planning
to date her seriously.

7
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.660
please don't do anything to confuse her.

8
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.960
I'm not saying this to you impulsively.

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.530
Ji-wook.

10
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.400
Why are you saying this to me?

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.710
Because I like Saet-byul.

12
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.480
What were you guys talking about?

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.180
-Ji-wook told me--
-Did something happen?

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.420
No. everything's fine.
The shoot is going to start soon.

15
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.020
Let's go. Mr. Choi. Come on.

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.220
We're here.

17
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.500
Oh. Ji-wook. Hurry. Come here.
Let's fix your makeup.

18
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.460
Sure.

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.030
Our Prince Ji-wook is here.
Hurry. come on. We have no time.

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.500
-Mr. Choi. here.
-We're going to shoot it like this.

21
00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.940
SHINSEONG-DONG
-Mr. Choi. here.
-We're going to shoot it like this.

22
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.000
SHINSEONG-DONG

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.170
-Hold this and smile.
-Okay.
SHINSEONG-DONG

24
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.310
SHINSEONG-DONG

25
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.440
-We'll start the shooting.
-Sure.
SHINSEONG-DONG

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.040
-We'll start the shooting.
-Sure.

27
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.250
What's he dolling up for?
Like that's going to make a difference?

28
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.120
-Come on. he's a celebrity. Mr. Choi.
-Thank you. You're handsome too.

29
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.220
Oh. come on. It's embarrassing me.

30
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.560
Gosh. what's so special
about putting makeup on?

31
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.030
He's just a human being after all.

32
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.660
I'll show them who's the pretty boy.

33
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.300
Hello. I'm Choi Dae-hyun.

34
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.940
He's the star who caught a thief
at the convenience store.

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.010
Mr. Kang will be a store manager
for the next 25 hours. Let's begin!

36
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.980
Go Star25!

37
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.450
-Yes!
-Ji-wook! You're handsome!

38
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.210
YOU'RE THE BEST. KANG JI-WOOK!
-Yes!
-Ji-wook! You're handsome!

39
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.280
YOU'RE THE BEST. KANG JI-WOOK!

40
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.110
Look here!
YOU'RE THE BEST. KANG JI-WOOK!

41
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.450
Look here!

42
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.450
It's 15.800 won. Do you have
any discount or loyalty cards?

43
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.490
Here.

44
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.290
-Please enjoy.
-Goodness!

45
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.420
Here you go.

46
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060
Ji-wook just touched my phone!

47
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.660
I'm not going to change my phone.

48
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.420
-Hey.
-I can't help today.

49
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.420
Excuse me.

50
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.800
Can you please check these items out?

51
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.270
-Hurry.
-Oh. no.

52
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.110
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

53
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.040
Darn it. I can't tell
who the store manager is. right?

54
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.510
HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH
Darn it. I can't tell
who the store manager is. right?

55
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.670
Darn it. I can't tell
who the store manager is. right?

56
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.380
I'm sorry. I'll give you a new one.

57
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.620
No. it's okay. Please just check them out.

58
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.790
We'd come every day
if you run a convenience store. Ji-wook.

59
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.460
Really? Should I take
the store manager spot here?

60
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.760
-Yes!
-Yes! That sounds great!

61
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.060
-Ji-wook. can you take a picture with us?
-Sure.

62
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.970
Ji-wook. can you take it outside?

63
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.500
I'll take it outside with you all.

64
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.240
-Yes!
-Let's go out.

65
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.800
Hey. let's go.

66
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.070
It's 3.600 won.

67
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.010
I'm really sorry. but I'll come next time.
Sorry!

68
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.040
Me too! Wait up!

69
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.110
It's Kang Ji-wook!

70
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.250
-Oh. my gosh!
-We're taking pictures together!

71
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.040
-What's this?
-An herb tonic.

72
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.210
I know you were nervous.
but how could you make such a mistake?

73
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.110
Eat it up.

74
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.480
Gosh. fine.

75
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.020
Mr. Choi. did you put makeup on?

76
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.820
No. Goodness. no way.

77
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.090
Who did you do it for?

78
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.330
-It's all over here.
-Hey!

79
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.130
My skin's pale to begin with.

80
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.300
He's so cute.

81
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.950
I look fine.

82
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.690
What? This...

83
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.000
Darn it. it was too dark in here.

84
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.800
Saet-byul. what's up?

85
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.400
-Hey. what's your problem?
-What are you talking about?

86
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.370
If you're here to work. just work.
Why did you have to humiliate Mr. Choi?

87
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.880
Are you seriously going to become
a store manager? You're not. right?

88
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.880
It's for the show. I can't just work.
It wouldn't be entertaining.

89
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.980
Do you feel inferior to Mr. Choi?

90
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.580
Because he's better looking than you?

91
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.850
You think I'm uglier than him?

92
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.290
Of course.

93
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.490
Look in the mirror and check for yourself.
You're no match to Mr. Choi.

94
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.590
Hey!

95
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.730
Mr. Choi gets nervous
when he's in front of the camera.

96
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.300
He's different from guys like you
who live in front of cameras.

97
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.800
Why are you talking so much in favor
of Mr. Choi?

98
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.740
That's right.
I'm talking on behalf of Mr. Choi.

99
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.470
Mr. Choi is soon turning 30.

100
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.080
He's different from us. Have you seen
the wrinkles on his forehead?

101
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.880
That's why he has bangs.
Do you understand?

102
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.120
I hope you can be considerate.

103
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.390
-But--
-You'd better!

104
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.590
What the...

105
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.700
Darn you. Saet-byul.

106
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.610
Geum-bi. talk with me. What's going on?

107
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.680
I'm okay. Dad.

108
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.890
Dad. I'm so miserable.

109
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.590
Hello?

110
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.360
Fire Volcano. what's going on?

111
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.930
You're not updating your work.
and you haven't been answering calls.

112
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.830
Sir.

113
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.240
What is life?

114
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.940
Geum-bi.

115
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.980
I'll do everything you say.

116
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.750
so please open this door!

117
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.990
Han Dal-sik. are you mad?
Why are you talking about life?

118
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.990
-Do you really want to get fired?
-Shut it!

119
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.380
Did you pay for that?

120
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.280
Yes. I paid for it with my money.

121
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.650
Where's Mr. Choi?

122
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.420
Goodness.
you never stop talking about him.

123
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.190
Do you like him that much?
He doesn't seem to like you that much.

124
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.120
Hey. you're totally wrong.

125
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.560
He's totally into me.

126
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.600
Goodness gracious.
your delusions are severe.

127
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.200
-What? I'm deluding?
-Yes. you are.

128
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.000
-Why you--
-Just eat this.

129
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.970
It's good.

130
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.510
It is good.

131
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.420
You're on your shift right now.
Why aren't you working?

132
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.790
How come you're eating popsicles.
joking around with a friend?

133
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.390
I'M DONE WORKING.

134
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.160
You didn't prepare the Shinseong-noodles.

135
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.900
We finished that talk last night.

136
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.030
I'm bringing tripe later on.

137
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.370
Mr. Kwon might forget.

138
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.070
So you'd better check it now.

139
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.710
What are you doing?

140
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.400
What do you think? I'm talking with him.

141
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.450
What? This is talking?

142
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.310
If we can communicate. it's working.

143
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.120
How can you communicate like this?
Stop kidding me.

144
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.920
Hey. it does work for me.

145
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.820
Goodness. You're...

146
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.060
YOU'RE UGLY.

147
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.060
What was that?

148
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:38.860
And this?

149
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.070
SUPERMARKET

150
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.100
Hey. I got here just on time.

151
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.440
Did you wait for me?

152
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.870
Yes. I wanted to go to
the convenience store with you.

153
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.040
Why?

154
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.640
I'm worried that
Dae-hyun might make a mistake.

155
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.510
We should go and show him support.

156
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.180
Forget it. What if we bump into Yeon-joo?

157
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.290
So what? It's our convenience store too.

158
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.850
It's not like I did something wrong.

159
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.190
Let's go to the tripe restaurant
and take a peek.

160
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.700
Okay. whatever.
Let's go to the tripe restaurant.

161
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.830
Let's go.

162
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.000
Let go. I'm hot.

163
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.710
Ta-da.

164
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.340
This is made with our store's spicy

165
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.010
-bibimmyeon.
-Bibimmyeon.

166
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.880
SHINSEONG-DONG
-bibimmyeon.
-Bibimmyeon.

167
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.040
SHINSEONG-DONG

168
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.810
-And tripe.
-And tripe from the tripe restaurant.
SHINSEONG-DONG

169
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.410
It's a special recipe.

170
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.720
-The Shinseong-noodles.
-We call it the Shinseong-noodles.

171
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.620
I'll show you how to make it from now on.

172
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.520
Put this in cold spicy noodles.

173
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.990
-I'll take a bite.
-Sure.

174
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.860
BIBIMMYEON

175
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.800
It's really good.

176
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.860
-It is really good.
-Right.

177
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.500
This is really

178
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.970
-a mind-blowing recipe. right?
-Cut!

179
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.100
Cut.

180
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.640
My gosh.

181
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.510
-Hey.
-Yes?

182
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.210
Why would you mention
another tripe restaurant

183
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.810
when this is to promote
the convenience store?

184
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:03.880
SHINSEONG-DONG
when this is to promote
the convenience store?

185
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:03.950
SHINSEONG-DONG

186
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.020
I just wanted to share a tip
to my customers.
SHINSEONG-DONG

187
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.050
I just wanted to share a tip
to my customers.

188
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.220
Exactly.
We have products made with tripe too.

189
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.350
Yes. we do. It's 6.000 won.

190
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.390
Which is why people would prefer
buying it at a tripe restaurant.

191
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.360
Can't you think for those who supply
tripe products to convenience stores?

192
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.700
Okay. refrigerated tripe products do sell.

193
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.160
But I'm talking about demand here.

194
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.600
To be honest. I think we should thank
the tripe restaurant owners

195
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.840
who provide tripe at 1.500 won.

196
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.770
I believe it will benefit
our convenience stores in the end

197
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.580
if we could improve our local economy
by helping out each other.

198
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.850
Can't you think of selling
at least one more item off the shelves?

199
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.120
Stop trying to make an impression.

200
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.750
-Mr. Bae.
-What?

201
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.490
I'm the owner of this branch.

202
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.790
Not your subordinate from the head office.

203
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.060
Fine.

204
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.500
Hey. stop shooting.
Just delete everything.

205
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.330
Quit shooting. Turn off the cameras.

206
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.630
My gosh. come on!

207
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.910
You're crossing the line.
Mr. Out-of-breath.

208
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.280
Is your mouth a sprayer or what?

209
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.350
Look here. your saliva is
all over this holy Shinseong-noodles.

210
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.310
I knew this would happen
when I saw you out of breath.

211
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.950
Gosh.

212
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.150
What?

213
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.590
Hey. let's take a 10-minute break.

214
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.760
-Get out.
-Let's go.

215
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.490
-I bet he's embarrassed!
-Hey!

216
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.630
What?

217
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.830
-Good job.
-What?

218
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.600
-Good job.
-Really?

219
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.640
Of course.

220
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.210
-Good job.
-Really?

221
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.770
Eat up.

222
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.680
Is that true?

223
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.950
Stop the shoot and wait.
I'll be there soon.

224
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.050
-Okay.
-What's wrong?

225
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.520
I think Mr. Bae had some issues
with Dae-hyun.

226
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.550
-I have to stop by and check.
-I'll go with you.

227
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.660
No need. I'll call you
as soon as things wrap up.

228
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.070
"I'm the owner of this branch.
Not your subordinate."

229
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.780
Don't you think Mr. Choi is so cool?

230
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.080
He's more than his looks.

231
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.080
I thought you were even cooler.

232
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.620
Of course. I'm cool too.

233
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.320
But I'm no match compared to Mr. Choi.

234
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.660
Welcome.

235
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.430
Are you looking for something?

236
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.730
Where's Mr. Choi?

237
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.600
See? He's looking for Mr. Choi
as soon as he walked in.

238
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.510
What do you need him for?

239
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.280
It's okay. I know about
the Dreaming Tree Card.

240
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.010
I'm a regular employee here.
I'll check that out for you.

241
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.390
Hey. kid. What's wrong?

242
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.920
Oh. goodness. I almost missed my VIP.

243
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.920
I didn't know you were here. Yeong-seo.

244
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.060
Mr. Choi.

245
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.260
Yes. of course. I should check you out.

246
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.230
We can't let them do it.
They're not good at it.

247
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.960
Can you two excuse us?

248
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.900
-What? We should go out?
-Just for a moment.

249
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.040
Okay. let me check these out for you.
Please come over here.

250
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.210
Beep.

251
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.680
Beep.

252
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.750
Beep.

253
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.550
Sausage. Beep.

254
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.320
Meal box. Beep.

255
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.830
Okay. that's 20.000 won.

256
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.400
You're paying with your card.

257
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.400
Swipe.

258
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.640
Why did you come so late?

259
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.570
Wait.

260
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.280
You don't have milk.

261
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.550
You have to drink a lot of milk
to grow tall.

262
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.680
Okay.

263
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.660
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

264
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.760
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

265
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.300
I heard there was
an uncomfortable situation early on.

266
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.610
I'd like to apologize on behalf
of our employee's impolite behavior.

267
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.110
I'm sorry. sir.

268
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.740
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.150
No. it's okay.
I didn't do anything right either.

270
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.950
Please make sure this never happens again.

271
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.320
I'm speaking as an employee.

272
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.490
Sure.

273
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.260
-Go inside. Mr. Choi.
-Go inside?

274
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.370
Please wrap up the shoot well.

275
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.040
-What?
-Mr. Choi.

276
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.940
You should've just accepted the apology.

277
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.070
Why did you have to be so modest

278
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.010
and cave in like that?

279
00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.780
I did?

280
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.250
Don't do that ever again. Okay?

281
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.550
Okay.

282
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.220
From now on. I won't stay still
if anyone steps on you.

283
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.520
You know me. right?

284
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.360
This sound isn't coming from my mouth.

285
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.760
You know. right?

286
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.260
-I think it did come from your mouth.
-No way.

287
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.070
Goodness.

288
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.670
You know what. though?
I think you are a little bit reliable.

289
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.210
you know?

290
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.080
I've hired a good employee.

291
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.280
I know.

292
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.150
Call me your guardian angel now.

293
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.620
Stay right next to me.

294
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.150
What? A guardian angel?

295
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.120
Do you want me to stick to you
like this all the time?

296
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.660
About this much?

297
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.800
-Well. that's...
-No. this much.

298
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.260
No. get off me.

299
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.900
You have to stick to me.
I'm your guardian angel.

300
00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.770
Okay. I'll be keeping my eye on you.

301
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.810
-Keep up the good work.
-Goodbye.

302
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.310
-Bye.
-I'm sorry.

303
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.380
Hey.

304
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.280
No. it's okay. Seung-joon.
You don't have to come.

305
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.920
It's wrapped up. I'm going home now.

306
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.120
What could I have done?
I just apologized and ended things there.

307
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.530
I guess this neighborhood doesn't suit me.

308
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.360
I don't like anything about it.

309
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.000
Okay.

310
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.070
I guess she said that for me to hear.

311
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.440
Hello.

312
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.080
You saw me from afar.
why bother saying hello now?

313
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.210
I didn't know you were here.

314
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.580
How have you been?

315
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.520
I've been doing well.

316
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.750
Well. I'll get going.

317
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.590
I guess you don't like this neighborhood.

318
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.660
Pardon?

319
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.030
You judge the neighborhood by its looks.

320
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.920
So I get that this place looks
below your standards.

321
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
It's a poor neighborhood. I know that.

322
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.070
But people from our neighborhood
aren't rude like you.

323
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.240
No. that's not what I meant.

324
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.340
Do you think we don't have pride
because we're poor?

325
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.410
Don't you know that things
you just blurt out thoughtlessly

326
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.580
can hurt some people?

327
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.250
Let's go. Get up.
Hey. put this on our tab. Let's go.

328
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.170
What's this?

329
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.240
-Hurry.
-Oh. no.

330
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.370
Darn it.

331
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.510
HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH

332
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.510
She must have left it here.

333
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.830
HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH

334
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.470
KIM CHA-YOON. BAEKAM GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

335
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.340
SPEAK OUT.

336
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.250
"What do you want to do"
SPEAK OUT.

337
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:23.380
"What do you want to do"

338
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.320
"in your life?"

339
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.420
"Talk about it"

340
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.690
"with your partner."

341
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.430
"In the..."

342
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.470
-What are you doing?
-You startled me.

343
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.700
What are you up to?
You didn't even hear me walk in.

344
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.880
Oh. this? Earlier today.

345
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.480
-Okay.
-the girls who came to see Puppy left it.

346
00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.450
Goodness. I knew it. I saw this coming.

347
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.220
They're still in school.
but they chased around a celebrity.

348
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.690
They left their book
because they wanted a photo with him.

349
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.490
They forgot about their main duty.

350
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.590
They'll come back to pick it up.

351
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.300
Hey. Saet-byul.

352
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.540
Do you not want to go back to school?

353
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.270
I'm going to take the GED.

354
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.910
Really? When?

355
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.580
I can't take it now because I'm busy.

356
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.150
Later. I'll take it someday.

357
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.850
"Later"? "Someday"? When is that exactly?

358
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.420
When I have time.
I'll take it when I have time.

359
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.020
When you have time.

360
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.660
I need my GED if I want to be a manager.

361
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.490
A manager? What manager?

362
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.100
A convenience store manager.
I'll be a convenience store manager.

363
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.170
Why would you want
to be a convenience store manager?

364
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.970
You wanted to be a florist.

365
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.040
You remember that?

366
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.840
Of course. I do.

367
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.840
My dream changed
because I saw something awesome today.

368
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.910
How awesome was it?
You even changed your dream because of it.

369
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.890
Beep. beep. beep. Swipe.

370
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.220
Gosh. you saw that?

371
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.660
I want to be a cool manager like you.
Beep. beep.

372
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.130
That's a secret between Yeong-seo and me.

373
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.170
That's the coolest secret in the world.

374
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.610
Mr. Choi. you know.

375
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.150
after working here as a part-timer.

376
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.320
I began to get more attached
to a convenience store.

377
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:47.690
And it made me think that I became
a helpful person to someone.

378
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.730
I thought about how it would feel
to be a manager like you.

379
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.200
Today was the day I made up my mind.

380
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.340
Mr. Choi.

381
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.670
you're the best.

382
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.240
-The best!
-My gosh.

383
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.810
She only smiles like that to Mr. Choi.

384
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.880
You're in big trouble.

385
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.450
Once you're hooked on my charms.
you can't get out.

386
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.920
It's impossible to get over me.

387
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.700
Saet-byul. you should go home
and get some sleep. Aren't you tired?

388
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.470
You should go. I'll stay here.

389
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.470
Okay. I'll go home.

390
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.510
You know what? I'm turning 30 soon.

391
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.110
Every day is a challenge for me.

392
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.810
Gosh. my body feels very different
from when I was young.

393
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.880
My gosh. you're so petty.
When did you hear that?

394
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.550
-Mr. Choi.
-What?

395
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.090
-You know what?
-What?

396
00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.230
Is that why you're showing me
your forehead?

397
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.600
No. that's not it. Actually.

398
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.230
I style my hair like this from time
to time. It's similar to Ji-wook's.

399
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.540
Look at it. I have no wrinkles.

400
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.700
You look nice.

401
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.010
Bye.

402
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.880
It is impossible to get over him.

403
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.190
My gosh. I'm so tired.

404
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.190
Ji-wook.

405
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.160
What are you doing here?

406
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.530
I was just...

407
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.270
-It looked like I shouldn't interrupt you.
-Pardon?

408
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.770
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes.

409
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.940
-You know. Saet-byul...
-What about her?

410
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.810
What about Saet-byul?
Did something happen to her? What is it?

411
00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.780
No. it's nothing. By the way.

412
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.680
your hairstyle looks familiar.

413
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.120
Oh. this?
You know. it's a popular hairstyle.

414
00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.120
A lot of celebrities wear this hairstyle.
but I came up with this a long time ago.

415
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.360
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes. home.

416
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.930
Bye. I'll stay with Saet-byul.

417
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.770
-No. you should go home.
-Me?

418
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.940
Yes. You should go home.

419
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.170
But you said you were going home.

420
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.710
No. I never said that.
I was going to tell you to go home.

421
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.210
I thought you might be tired.
You have to stay up all night.

422
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.650
No. I'm too young to get tired
from an all-nighter.

423
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.220
You look tired. Mr. Choi. Very tired.

424
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.560
No. I'm not tired at all.
I'm full of energy.

425
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.730
"Full of energy". I haven't heard
that expression for so long.

426
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.530
You know. old people often use
that expression. "Full of energy".

427
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.930
No. that's not true.
I heard young kids use this expression.

428
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.770
You know. it's getting trendy these days.
The theme. retro.

429
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.040
"Retro".

430
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.840
Then. I'll go inside.

431
00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.380
I was just about to go back inside.

432
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.300
What's this? It's like
you're competing in a 100m race.

433
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.660
Saet-byul. I came back in.
so I could stay with you.

434
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:17.030
Saet-byul. let's have a meeting.

435
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.130
I thought you were going home. Mr. Choi.

436
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.000
When did I tell you that I was going home?
I just wanted some fresh air.

437
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.340
-Then. you'll stay here. right?
-Of course.

438
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.580
-And you'll stay here too?
-Of course.

439
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.810
Then. you two should stay
and have a meeting too.

440
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.450
I should go and take a nap.

441
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.320
-Saet-byul.
-Saet-byul.

442
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.800
GO STAR 25!

443
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.470
All right. I just finished working
at the store for 25 hours.

444
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.740
It was difficult. yet comfortable
as if I was at home.

445
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.270
Please use our convenience store a lot.

446
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.040
Bye.

447
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.980
Cut. Good job.

448
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.610
-Good work.
-Good work.

449
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.650
-Good job.
-Great job.

450
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.650
-Guys. get your stuff and get out.
-Well done.

451
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.420
-Let's take a group photo.
-Great job.

452
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.860
-Thank you.
-Good job.

453
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.860
-Great job.
-Good work.

454
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.190
Good job.

455
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.360
Mr. Choi. thank you for your cooperation.

456
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.970
Good work.

457
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.300
-Update me later.
-Okay.

458
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.910
-Bye.
-Bye.

459
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.240
LIFESTYLE PLATFORM. GS25
-Bye.
-Bye.

460
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.880
LIFESTYLE PLATFORM. GS25

461
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.950
-Let's clean up and go home. Well done.
-Okay.

462
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.820
-Load our stuff on the car.
-Okay.

463
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.180
Okay? Let's go home.

464
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.760
Look at him.

465
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.290
He's smiling at her with his eyes.
That's so unmanly.

466
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.100
Seriously.

467
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.170
Mr. Choi.

468
00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.270
Yes. what is it?

469
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.340
-Can I take a half-day off?
-A half-day off?

470
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.210
I need to go somewhere with Puppy.

471
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.410
Don't you know
we have a lot of stuff to do?

472
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.010
You're an employee.
Why do you keep trying to take time off?

473
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.550
Is this what our store deserves?

474
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.720
No. it's not because I want to go out.

475
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.050
I heard that Eun-byul's showcase is today.
The one I told you about yesterday.

476
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.620
-The showcase is today?
-Yes.

477
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.090
You should definitely go.

478
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.060
Do you have to go with Mr. Kang?

479
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.060
Puppy knows everyone
from Eun-byul's agency.

480
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.930
-So I have to go with him.
-Should I join you?

481
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.070
What? Why?

482
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.440
I consider it as a happy occasion
for our convenience store.

483
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.970
I'll watch the showcase
and come back right away.

484
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.850
-No?
-Go ahead.

485
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.420
I'll be back soon. okay? Mr. Choi.

486
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.990
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

487
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.490
-Have fun.
-Puppy!

488
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.320
Let's go.

489
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.860
-I'll go change.
-Okay. Hurry.

490
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.490
Ji-wook.

491
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.360
The movie production just called.

492
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:01.900
You need to dub the movie today.

493
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.600
Ask them to reschedule.
Tell them I have another appointment.

494
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.000
How can I tell them
that when you're available?

495
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.470
This is work.

496
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.610
Hey. you should go work.
Your work is more important.

497
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.810
I'll go alone.

498
00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.820
Yes. Go. Just leave.

499
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.020
-Hold on.
-It's all right. Hurry.

500
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.760
-Good work. Thank you.
-Okay.

501
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.930
You have to return the uniform.

502
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.500
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

503
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.860
Oh. no. Look at him!

504
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.300
-He's so handsome.
-Gosh.

505
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.030
-You're so hot.
-Well.

506
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.140
she didn't need him. Why did she...

507
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.070
-Fancy Girls!
-Fancy Girls!

508
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.480
-Fancy Girls!
-Fancy Girls!

509
00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.680
I hope we do well.

510
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:55.120
-Fancy Girls!
-Did we get everything we need?

511
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.480
FANCY GIRLS

512
00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.390
I love you. Fancy Girls!
FANCY GIRLS

513
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.090
I love you. Fancy Girls!

514
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.990
-Fancy Girls!
-Fancy Girls!

Hey. Saet-byul.

Saet-byul. Hey. tell me how it went.

563
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.670
Did she do well?

564
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.770
Probably?

565
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.340
"Probably"?

566
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.210
Why probably? You couldn't go?

567
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.450
Hey. you...

568
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.320
Is it because Mr. Kang wasn't with you?

569
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.890
No. I got too nervous to watch.

570
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.420
I see. You were nervous.
so you couldn't watch it.

571
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.260
-Were you eating ramyeon?
-Yes.

572
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.930
Hey. Eun-jo.

573
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.530
Saet-byul. something happened to Eun-byul.

574
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.230
Eun-byul? What is it?

575
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.970
Hang up the phone
and watch the video I sent you.

576
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.000
Do it now!

577
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.210
Gosh. what is it? What?

578
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.620
That must be your sister.

579
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.720
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

580
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.820
Oh. no.

581
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:07.810
Yes!

582
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.820
Saet-byul. did you watch it?

583
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.120
You fool. Why did you trip?

584
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.060
But still. I got right back up.

585
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.630
Good job. my sister.

586
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.730
Did your nosebleed stop?

587
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.000
Yes. you beat me up so many times
when I was young.

588
00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.870
That was nothing to me.

589
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.010
Hey. had I known this would come in handy.
I should've beaten you up a bit more.

590
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.380
After coming off the stage.

591
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.750
you were the first person I thought of.

592
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.720
To me. you are

593
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:52.620
my dad and my mom.

594
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.260
You went through a lot because of me.

595
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.990
Thank you.

596
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.060
And I'm sorry.

597
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.000
Hey. are you serious?

598
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.770
Did you finally grow up?

599
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.240
Do you know
how much I wanted to tell you this?

600
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.010
Saet-byul. hang in there a bit more.

601
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.980
I'll give you a good life.

602
00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.520
Hey. you're not even close.

603
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.260
You just made a debut.

604
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.030
You need to work harder. okay?

605
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.260
Okay.

606
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.030
Bye.

607
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.570
Bye.

608
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.510
THE NEXT EPISODE WILL AIR SOON

609
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.450
Saet-byul. did you cry? Did you?

610
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.650
No.

611
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.620
Hey. you did. Why did you cry?

612
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.990
I guess you cry too.

613
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.220
Well. people yawn
and shed a tear here and there.

614
00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.790
You can't get the dry eye syndrome.

615
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.160
Unbelievable. You're so petty!

616
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:19.860
Hey. Saet-byul. Congratulations.

617
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.630
Your sister was so cool.
I think she'll make it.

618
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:29.270
Actually. I've been through a lot
because of her.

619
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.940
She was burdensome.
and I wanted to punch her.

620
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.040
But seeing how hard she's working
even after getting a nosebleed.

621
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:38.380
I was proud of her
and also felt bad at the same time.

622
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.550
I'm sure she knows how you feel too.

623
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.820
She's your family.

624
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.320
Thank you. Mr. Choi.

625
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.860
Gosh. don't mention it. I didn't do much.

626
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.660
But usually. when people are grateful.

627
00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.770
they give presents to show
their appreciation. That's what people do.

628
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.500
It's not like you made the debut.

629
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.970
What do you expect? Is this what you want?

630
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.960
Saet-byul.

631
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.380
No one's ever given me a bouquet before.

632
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.500
I don't know if I'm worthy of this.
Thank you so much.

633
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:30.470
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

634
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.570
-Put that in the vase. okay?
-What?

635
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.540
Make sure it looks nice.

636
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:39.440
-You want me to put it in the vase?
-Yes.

637
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.280
I knew it.

638
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.990
-My gosh.
-The celebrity is here.

639
00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.060
My gosh. I almost didn't recognize you.

640
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.830
Don't get too intimidated.

641
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.570
Hey. let's take a photo
to commemorate this moment.

642
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:07.070
"A photo"?

643
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.240
Gather around.

644
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.840
From now on. think carefully
before you take any photos.

645
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.140
A single photo could
put your career in jeopardy.

646
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.450
Keep that in mind. okay?

647
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.610
-Okay.
-Okay.

648
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.320
Can we take a photo later?

649
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.220
-My gosh. come on.
-Just one will do.

650
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.020
-Smile. Look.
-Smile. In 1. 2. 3.

651
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.090
Cheese.

652
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.860
-It came out nice.
-Yes. it did.

653
00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.960
-Let's save it in Eun-byul's folder.
-Save it.

654
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.000
"Eun-byul's folder"?

655
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.170
Yes. this phone has tons of photos
from your past.

656
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.300
Do you want to take a look?

657
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.150
Eun-byul. you promised to pay us
half your earnings. right?

658
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.650
But I haven't gotten paid yet.

659
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.460
Yes. I know.
But you see. we're broke these days.

660
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.530
We have no money.

661
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.130
Go ahead and answer it.

662
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.200
-Go ahead.
-My gosh.

663
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.940
Darn it.

664
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.110
Hello?

665
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.210
Congratulations. Eun-byul.

666
00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.310
What? Who is this?

667
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.750
Oh. I guess you don't have my number.
It's Ji-wook.

668
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.720
Oh. hey. Ji-wook.

669
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.990
"Kang Ji-wook"?

670
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720
Be quiet.

671
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.790
Eun-byul. don't become careless
just because you became famous.

672
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.960
Make sure you always stay cautious.
I'll see you soon.

673
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.760
Okay. Thank you.

674
00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.440
Eun-byul. I have an idea.

675
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.910
What?

676
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.480
Let's do our best like always. Saet-byul.

677
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.780
EXPIRED

678
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:04.920
Hey. wait a minute.
Why are you throwing away so many stuff?

679
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.290
Dal-sik normally eats
the butter soy sauce...

680
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.130
Saet-byul. when was the last time
you saw Dal-sik?

681
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.630
Your friend?

682
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.460
I think it's been a few days.

683
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.270
Wait a minute. Dal-sik...
Saet-byul. wait here for a moment.

684
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.840
Dal-sik.

685
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.980
Hey! Oh. my gosh! Dal-sik!

686
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.340
My gosh!

687
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.250
Dal-sik. wake up! Dal-sik!

688
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.550
Hey. Dal-sik! Hey!

689
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.690
Hey. are you okay? Wake up!

690
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:41.060
-Hey!
-Let me just die like this.

691
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.030
Why would you want to die? Hey. wake up.

692
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.200
Hey! Wait. You...

693
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.170
You met that fan of yours. didn't you?

694
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.700
It was a guy. right? What did I tell you?
I told you that person is a guy.

695
00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:58.570
It would've been much better
if it turned out to be a guy.

696
00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.180
Dal-sik! Are you okay?

697
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.120
Dal-sik! Hey. breathe!

698
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.920
Hey!

699
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.620
Saet-byul! Saet-byul! Hurry!

700
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.590
-Hey. open up!
-What's going on?

701
00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.930
Get me one butter soy sauce
beef triangular gimbap and banana milk.

702
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.560
-Okay. just a second.
-Hurry.

703
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.400
Hey. Dal-sik. are you okay?
Dal-sik. wake up!

704
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.470
Dal-sik.

705
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.240
-Get me a new one!
-"A new one"?

706
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.770
Dal-sik. wake up! Dal-sik. breathe!

707
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:32.940
Hey. Hurry.

708
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.650
Dal-sik. this is butter soy sauce beef.

709
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.080
It hasn't expired. It's still good.

710
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.450
Hey. Eat this. Get up.

711
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.350
Dal-sik. eat this.

712
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.720
There you go. Do you feel better now?
Are you okay?

713
00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:51.060
Here.

714
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.760
He's eating it just fine.

715
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:57.330
You're better now. aren't you?

716
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.140
Eat it yourself. You darn punk.

717
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.770
Gosh. you totally alarmed me.
I saved your life.

718
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.210
Did something happen?

719
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.640
No. it's not a big deal.

720
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:12.350
He thought he was meeting a woman.
but it turned out to be a guy.

721
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.220
My gosh. I feel so bad for you.

722
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.390
It wasn't a guy. It was a monstrous woman.

723
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.960
It was a woman? Who was it?
Tell me who it was.

724
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.960
Why can't you tell me?

725
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.210
Saet-byul. why...

726
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:53.590
Why are you giving me such a hard time?

727
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:59.600
Is he crazy?

728
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.860
What's wrong with him?

729
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.310
Saet-byul. he's not someone
we can understand.

730
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.070
We just need to accept who he is.

731
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.950
EV ROOM

732
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.790
Ji-wook. please just this once.

733
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.790
Can you please help me just this once?

734
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.660
They took photos of me every time we met.

735
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.730
I can't have them leak those photos.

736
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.730
Why did you hang out with bullies?
You should've known better.

737
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.840
I swear I wasn't a bully.

738
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.010
I never did anything bad.

739
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.340
The kids made fun of me

740
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.550
for not having parents and being poor.

741
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.720
So I wanted to seem strong.

742
00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.720
Those girls promised to delete
all those photos

743
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.760
if I convinced you to meet them.

744
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.390
You're Eun-byul's guardian angel.
Protect her well.

745
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.930
BE HAPPY! KANG JI-WOOK

746
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.700
-Thank you. Your hands are so pretty.
-I know.

747
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.570
I heard you're very close with Eun-byul.

748
00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.440
She just started her career.
so please give her a lot of support.

749
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.410
Gosh. of course. If anyone
gets in her way. we won't stay still.

750
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.850
We'll beat them up. Right. Eun-byul?

751
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.650
Right.

752
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.690
Also. Eun-byul is still underage.

753
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.090
It's not right to call her out
to a pub like this.

754
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.260
Oh. right.

755
00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:40.530
We'll keep that in mind.
Let's keep that in mind. okay?

756
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:47.400
I came to meet you guys. so please keep
the promise you made to Eun-byul.

757
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.640
Yes. of course.
We even got your autograph.

758
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.440
Thank you.

759
00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.940
Eun-byul. we'll be off now.

760
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.250
-Bye.
-Thank you for the food.

761
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.490
Eun-byul. I don't think
you should stay close with them.

762
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.650
Okay. I won't.

763
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.060
Thank you. Ji-wook.

764
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.960
And please don't tell Saet-byul

765
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.160
that you met me today.

766
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:20.640
She really hates asking people for favors.

767
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.570
If she finds out I asked you for help.
she'll really kill me.

768
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.580
It's okay.

769
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.490
Kang Ji-wook made us walk on eggshells.

770
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:39.520
but look how kind he is to Eun-byul.

771
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.490
Gosh. this is hurting my ego.

772
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.060
How dare he embarrass us like that?

773
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.560
He'll soon find out that we're the best
when it comes to embarrassing people.

774
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.900
-Did you take a photo?
-Here.

775
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.940
It came out nicely.

776
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.510
SHINSEONG-NOODLES IS SO DELICIOUS.

777
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:57.640
I'M GOING BACK FOR SHINSEONG-NOODLES.

778
00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.040
Here you go.
I'M GOING BACK FOR SHINSEONG-NOODLES.

779
00:42:59.040 --> 00:42:59.110
Here you go.

780
00:42:59.110 --> 00:42:59.310
IT'S REALLY COST-EFFECTIVE
AND DELICIOUS.
Here you go.

781
00:42:59.310 --> 00:42:59.640
IT'S REALLY COST-EFFECTIVE
AND DELICIOUS.

782
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.580
-Over here!
-It's really delicious.
IT'S REALLY COST-EFFECTIVE
AND DELICIOUS.

783
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:00.640
-Over here!
-It's really delicious.

784
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.810
IT'S REALLY GOOD. YOU MUST TRY IT!
-Over here!
-It's really delicious.

785
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:01.840
IT'S REALLY GOOD. YOU MUST TRY IT!

786
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.210
I'M GOING TO HAVE IT EVERY DAY.

787
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280
-The noodles are spicy.
-Thank you.

788
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.480
and the tripe is savory.

789
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.820
-They taste great together.
-Just a moment.

790
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.290
-I strongly recommend Shinseong-noodles.
-Please wait there.

791
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:10.820
-Do you have Shinseong-noodles?
-Yes.

792
00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:12.760
First. you need to go inside

793
00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.560
and buy the spicy noodles first.

794
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.860
Thank you.

795
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.260
Hey. Saet-byul. people really love it.

796
00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.930
This is great.

797
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.300
-Nice.
-Nice.

798
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.340
Have you heard of the new rookie group
that was the talk of the town

799
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.300
on social media
before they even made their debut?

800
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.040
Yes. of course. She moved everyone
by continuing to dance on stage

801
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.280
even though her nose started to bleed.

802
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.350
Here is their debut stage.
It's "Emotion" by Fancy Girls.

803
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.110
-"The Show". play.
-Play.

804
00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.790
Hey. that's your sister. She's there.

805
00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:47.520
-It's her. right?
-Yes.

806
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.130
FANCY GIRLS

807
00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.040
She's a good dancer.

808
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:06.770
Eun-byul.

809
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:13.010
Saet-byul.

810
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.580
My little sister.

811
00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.250
I missed you.

812
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.650
-You didn't fall today.
-I did well. didn't I?

813
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.120
Yes. good job.

814
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.050
Mr. Choi.

815
00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.290
You're her little sister
that came out on TV. right?

816
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.190
Say hello. He's our manager.

817
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.470
Hello! Catch your fancy!

818
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:38.430
I'm Jung Eun-byul.
a member of Fancy Girls.

819
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.740
I heard a lot about you. Eun-byul.
It's nice to meet you.

820
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.740
And congratulations on your debut.

821
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:45.710
Thank you.

822
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.580
Saet-byul. wait here for a moment.

823
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.550
-I need to go to the storage room.
-Okay.

824
00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.450
-Aren't you hungry?
-What's the most delicious menu here?

825
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.650
Shinseong-noodles.

826
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.790
-"Shinseong-noodles"?
-It's a new menu.

827
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.220
Today. I'll let you pick
everything you want to eat.

828
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.030
Don't regret it.

829
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.600
Hey. it's buy 1. get 1 free.
I'm going to have some too.

830
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.580
Saet-byul.

831
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.450
What?

832
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.000
What's this? What is it?

833
00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.200
I never did this kind of stuff.

834
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.070
What should I do?

835
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.510
Ta-da.

836
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.310
Mr. Choi.

837
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.480
Eun-byul. I made you a cake
to celebrate your debut.

838
00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.550
Make a wish and blow out the candle.

839
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:04.620
Blow out the candle.

840
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.200
Why did the candle blow out on its own?
Let's try it again.

841
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:17.500
Here. Let's try it again.
This time. it's for real.

842
00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:20.540
Your wish will really come true.

843
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:23.640
In 1. 2...

844
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.350
Eun-byul. congratulations on your debut.

845
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:32.610
Thank you.

846
00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.390
Mr. Choi. Eun-byul needs to go now.

847
00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.520
-I'll be right back.
-What? Already?

848
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.620
-Good luck. Eun-byul.
-Thank you.

849
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.190
Good luck. Eun-byul.

850
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.700
Hey. what was the photo earlier?

851
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.010
You have 10 seconds to call me.

852
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.050
Hey. I was in practice.
so I didn't know you called.

853
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.120
I'm sorry.

854
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:15.120
I guess the photo really scared you.

855
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.190
You called right away.

856
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.530
Get me some money
to celebrate the debut.

857
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.500
What?

858
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:23.730
You have until tomorrow.

859
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.340
Hey. call that number again
and put me on the phone.

860
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.570
Why? No way. What are you going to say?

861
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.680
I always told you not to hang out
with girls like them.

862
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.640
Why did you not listen to me
and cause this mess?

863
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:39.780
Why don't just tell me what to do
instead of scolding me about the past?

864
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.420
Send me that photo right now.

865
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.390
-Why?
-Just send it to me.

866
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.760
My gosh. whatever.

867
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.390
Hey!

868
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:51.960
My goodness.

869
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.200
Saet-byul. can you come a bit early?

870
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.040
Gosh. it's not even time
for me to go to work yet.

871
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.170
He's such an evil boss.

872
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.920
-Mr. Choi.
-Hey. Saet-byul.

873
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:57.160
-What took you so long?
-Why did you want me here so early?

874
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:59.730
There's something I need you to do.

875
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.530
-I need to do something?
-Yes.

876
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:05.270
I already have a lot on my mind.

877
00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:06.800
But he called me to make me do something?

878
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.200
What are you grumbling?
You just badmouthed me. didn't you?

879
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:11.540
-You badmouthed me. right?
-No.

880
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:12.870
You didn't? Really?

881
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.140
Then come over here.
Let's go to the storage room.

882
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.980
-"The storage room"?
-Yes. we need to clean up.

883
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.210
My gosh. why?

884
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.880
-Hurry.
-It's not time for me to work yet.

885
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.080
-Gosh. just go inside.
-Mr. Choi.

886
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.120
Take a look at this.

889
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.240
Let me help you

890
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:46.510
with your studies.

891
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:48.740
Mr. Choi.

892
00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.880
You told me you want to study one day.

893
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:53.050
Let's start right now.

894
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.780
If you want to become a store manager.

895
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.320
you should at least graduate high school.

896
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:08.360
What's going on? Are you touched?

897
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.900
You're working with an amazing boss
who cares about the development

898
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.740
and self-growth of his employee.

899
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.140
Hey. Saet-byul.
What would you have done without me?

900
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.280
You must've done something really good
in your past life.

901
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.550
Saet-byul. what is it? What's wrong?

902
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.150
What? What are you...

903
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.590
Hey. Saet...

904
00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:40.330
Thank you.

905
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.140
Sure.

906
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.320
Saet-byul. the thing is...

907
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:03.790
I actually wanted

908
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.590
to hug you first.

909
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.330
Well. anyway.

910
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.770
this was all part of my plan.

911
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.570
You don't even know anything.

912
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.210
Anyway. work hard and study hard. okay?

913
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:27.610
Yes. sir.

914
00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:32.650
Let's do well.

915
00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.060
Nice!

916
00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.390
Let's sit down.

917
00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.960
He even got me a sitting cushion. My gosh.

918
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.600
YOUR BOSS IS WATCHING YOU!

919
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.830
My gosh. this is so cute.

920
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.670
Look at all this.

921
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.810
I'm so impressed with myself.

922
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.250
I'm very impressed.
I'd call myself an amazing leader.

923
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:15.090
What if she gets too happy
and starts to cry?

968
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.430
Ever since Mr. Choi worked here
at the head office.

969
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.500
he wanted to do a collaboration
with the local businesses.

970
00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:32.500
Yes. you're right.

971
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:34.470
Then he should've stayed
at the head office.

972
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:35.570
He's so pretentious.

973
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.040
He pretended to be cool when he quit.
and he's still acting that way.

974
00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:39.840
He's such a pretentious punk.

975
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:43.650
What do you mean
he pretended to be cool when he quit?

976
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.650
What?

977
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.150
Well. it just meant that he's handsome.

978
00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.190
I just meant to say he's pretentious.

979
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.590
Look at the comments.

980
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.300
What? A resignation letter?
No. don't hand it in.

981
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:06.940
I already did.

982
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.740
Why would you quit all of a sudden?
Why are you doing this?

983
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.040
No. Dae-hyun. This isn't right.

984
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:17.110
Yeon-joo.
I think this is the right thing to do.

987
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.270
PERSON IN CHARGE: PR TEAM. CHOI DAE-HYUN

988
00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:51.650
Do you remember
the voice phishing prevention campaign?

989
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:53.150
I was in charge.

990
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:55.550
but we never got to end it
due to our friction with the cops.

991
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.950
But the person in charge
was switched to Choi Dae-hyun.

992
00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:00.590
It was even submitted
to the disciplinary committee.

993
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.390
Let me hear it from you.
since you were his boss.

994
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:08.730
-No. I don't know any--
-Mr. Bae!

995
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.810
Director Cho told me not to tell you.

996
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.010
What? Director... Director Cho Seung-joon?

997
00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:28.580
If you promise to keep it a secret.
I'll be loyal and tell you what happened.

998
00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:36.520
He knows what Dae-hyun is like.

999
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:41.000
So he scared Dae-hyun that you might
get disciplined if things go wrong

1000
00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.870
and asked him to take the blame
on your behalf.

1001
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.870
-This is absurd.
-In return for that.

1002
00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.510
Dae-hyun asked him
not to tell you anything.

1003
00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:58.750
And Director Cho already knew
he was going to ask for that.

What's this?

1008
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.740
I got all the important questions wrong.

1009
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.070
It's because I haven't studied in a while.
This is hard.

1010
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:32.950
Okay. I've made the orders.

1011
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.780
We have enough change.

1012
00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:38.420
I cleaned the entire place
and filled up the racks.

1013
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:41.120
And as for my studies...
I should study a bit harder.

1014
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:46.530
Mr. Choi just needs to come to work
and spend time looking at me.

1015
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.630
He should be here by now.
Isn't he here yet?

1016
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.070
I need to put lipstick on.

1017
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.540
Why isn't he coming?

1018
00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:06.650
There he is. He's coming.

I wonder if Saet-byul is studying hard.

1022
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.120
Is it time for me to be a teacher now?

1023
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:16.520
I should be very strict with her.

1024
00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:18.790
-Dae-hyun.
-She's...

1025
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.600
Why didn't you tell me?

1026
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.940
Why did you lie to me?

1027
00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.720
I'm sorry. Dae-hyun.

1028
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.230
I'll turn everything back to normal.
