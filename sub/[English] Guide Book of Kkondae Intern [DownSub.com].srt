00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,196
Hello!

2
00:00:01,255 --> 00:00:03,795
I'm a Senior Intern Lee Man Sik.

3
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:07,125
(MBC's new miniseries "Kkondae Intern" on Wednesdays and Thursdays)

4
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,066
"Kkondae Intern" is MBC's new ambitious miniseries...

5
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,305
on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

6
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,305
A bunch of losers came at once.

7
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:18,805
The genre of this drama is comedy, based in an office setting.

8
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:20,145
It's a so-called office comedy.

9
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,746
It is a favorite subject in movies and dramas.

10
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:25,586
You must be aware of the changing trends...

11
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:28,286
and lead that trend in the industry.

12
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:32,656
With changing times, office dramas have also evolved.

13
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,296
15 years ago, there was an office drama called "Super Rookie".

14
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:37,565
The title basically gave it away.

15
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:38,826
(Kang Ho)

16
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:41,466
At least in this drama, he starts off working full time.

17
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,135
Many young people are having a hard time finding jobs.

18
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:48,976
You must have struggled a lot. You look slightly mature.

19
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:52,775
In order to become an employee now, you must start as a contract worker.

20
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:54,146
Who are they?

21
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:56,976
They're the recently hired contract workers.

22
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:59,385
You work double the full-time workers,

23
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:02,415
but get treated worse than a dog. It's truly not fair.

24
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:05,355
Tell your boss.

25
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,025
Jo Jang Poong is here.

26
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:10,396
Labor inspector at the Ministry of Employment and Labor is the lead.

27
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:13,495
He tries to punish corrupt business owners,

28
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:16,336
but even he couldn't get around this.

29
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:19,635
I made myself clear. Don't do it.

30
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:22,376
His senior at work never approves anything.

31
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:23,405
On top of that...

32
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:25,206
I've been a public servant for 30 years.

33
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,876
20 years of that was in the Ministry of Labor.

34
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:29,775
I have three times more experience than you.

35
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,915
You saw that coming. He's talking about the old days.

36
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:34,855
- So? - When the time is right.

37
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:36,086
When's that?

38
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:40,855
At the right time, this relatable office drama is here.

39
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:44,265
It's an unbelievable situation where a senior who harassed me...

40
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:45,696
becomes my junior at work.

41
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:49,066
People can be wrong...

42
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:51,566
or have different opinions,

43
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:54,135
but they don't allow it.

44
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:57,545
They think people whose opinions are different from them are wrong.

45
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:59,045
I would call them old farts or "kkondae".

46
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:02,846
"Kkondae" could be somebody who's older...

47
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:07,515
and has a senior position at work. Superiors or bosses.

48
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:10,455
But it's not exclusive to them.

49
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:11,985
There are young people too.

50
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:15,196
If you're in a situation or a position...

51
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:16,996
to act like an old fart, you do.

52
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:20,026
This is a gratifying and touching revenge story...

53
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,066
surrounding their switched roles.

54
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:26,135
You're here as an intern, not a general director. An intern!

55
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:28,306
Not all interns are the same.

56
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:32,045
You must be wondering, so let's look into the main characters.

57
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:34,415
(Ga Yeol Chan)

58
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,776
He turns from a gentle boss to a kkondae.

59
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:38,645
He's a manager in marketing at Joonsoo Food...

60
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,746
and maker of Spicy Chicken Ramyeon. It's General Manager Ga Yeol Chan.

61
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:44,115
Hello, I play Ga Yeol Chan on "Kkondae Intern".

62
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,286
I'm Park Hae Jin.

63
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:49,626
He's handsome, tall, and fits perfectly in a suit.

64
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:54,795
Male employees are envious of him, and female employees cheer for him.

65
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,906
His abilities are widely recognized.

66
00:02:57,906 --> 00:03:00,105
The recipient is General Manager Ga Yeol Chan.

67
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:02,436
My focus is not on increasing exports.

68
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:04,346
Through our Spicy Chicken brand,

69
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:07,045
we'll lead the way for the K-Food wave.

70
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:10,145
He invents Spicy Chicken Ramyeon which gains huge popularity,

71
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:13,316
and this self-made man gets promoted to a general manager in no time.

72
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:15,686
Team lunches are a new trend.

73
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:17,985
When I heard...

74
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:19,686
"Team dinners are an extension of work," I thought this.

75
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:21,895
When I become a boss,

76
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:24,156
I will have team gatherings during work.

77
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:28,395
He's an open-minded boss who has team gatherings during work hours.

78
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:29,395
Furthermore...

79
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:30,496
It's 6pm already.

80
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:33,235
What are you doing? Aren't you going home?

81
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:34,605
Oh, right.

82
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:38,145
He's a work-and-life balance angel who lets people go home on time.

83
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:41,846
My employees will enjoy their evenings today as well.

84
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:44,175
It's hard to tell...

85
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,915
whether he cares about his employees or their perception of him.

86
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:48,915
General Manager Ga,

87
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:52,226
I analyzed our products.

88
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:53,256
Did you?

89
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,726
He might be cursing in his head.

90
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,665
He underlined everything.

91
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:00,726
But he keeps his manners.

92
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,066
I'll look through this in detail.

93
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:04,235
No wonder.

94
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,506
There's no boss like him.

95
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:09,335
He's an angel. An angel.

96
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:11,905
His employees love and respect him.

97
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,546
He looks good.

98
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:17,446
The executives trust him as well.

99
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:18,515
However,

100
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:22,385
he may look perfect, but he has a humiliating past.

101
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,585
Who keeps on giving that punk work?

102
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:26,225
Don't give him work!

103
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,496
When he was a rookie at work, his senior wasn't fond of him,

104
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,426
and he looked useless.

105
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:34,196
- Hey, Yeol Chan. - Yes, sir.

106
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:35,366
There's something for you to do.

107
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:36,535
Yes, sir.

108
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,265
This was what he made Yeol Chan do.

109
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:41,975
You need more sticks, right?

110
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:44,006
His chubby son's homework.

111
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,046
This is all for you.

112
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,416
Your job is to reassure your senior.

113
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,616
What else could it be?

114
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:51,816
Besides this strange logic...

115
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:53,916
Who called that punk?

116
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,556
He's going to spoil the mood. Who called him?

117
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:57,585
Get rid of that!

118
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,996
He could have been arrested for assault with his verbal abuse.

119
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:02,996
Move that thing!

120
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:06,496
He was an evil senior who was also physically violent.

121
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:07,895
He's an intern now.

122
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,095
What brings you here?

123
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:13,166
His shining life becomes troubled.

124
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,975
I don't know if you call it a coincidence or ill-fated,

125
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:18,046
but it's a resilient relationship.

126
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:21,946
We'll be facing hardships and adversities together.

127
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:25,285
Yeol Chan must have things he wants to say...

128
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:28,085
and things he doesn't like about his employees,

129
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,856
but he keeps it to himself, and you can tell.

130
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:33,056
I also can't express my feelings well.

131
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:34,955
I'm similar to him in that way.

132
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:37,155
Due to his sudden honorary retirement,

133
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:40,025
he went straight back to being a senior intern.

134
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,035
(Lee Man Sik, the ex-general manager and the current senior intern)

135
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,666
Hello, I'm Kim Eung Soo,

136
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,905
playing the role of Lee Man Sik in "Kkondae Intern".

137
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:47,676
I'm hard at work, being a kkondae.

138
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,335
Let's see how kkondae he is.

139
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,645
How dare an intern talk? What do you know?

140
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:57,275
Before his retirement, he was always picking at his subordinates.

141
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:58,585
Seriously?

142
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,916
And although he retired and is now a senior intern,

143
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,556
his old habits are still there.

144
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:05,655
What's up with your hair?

145
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:08,256
- Excuse me? - You're here to work, not to party.

146
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,325
Since he keeps spitting out kkondae comments,

147
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,996
his coworkers have given him a new nickname,

148
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,335
the Kkondae Intern!

149
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:16,895
Kkon-tern?

150
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:19,765
How dare they call me that? Do they know who I am?

151
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:22,876
I got a job at the ramyeon company right out of high school,

152
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:27,006
and I worked hard at the company my whole life.

153
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,546
I got promoted up to Team Leader, but...

154
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:30,946
What did I do wrong?

155
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:32,585
It's not that you did anything wrong.

156
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:35,015
Then what? Because I'm old?

157
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:36,215
You know...

158
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:39,686
how they consider firing us first when we reach this age.

159
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,825
It's sad, being forced to retire from a company...

160
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:42,926
that I've dedicated my whole life for.

161
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:45,095
I worked hard,

162
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:47,525
for my family and for the company.

163
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,465
And all that there's left after all of that hard work is...

164
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:51,135
my kkondae personality.

165
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:54,236
Man Sik cannot stop here, he has a family.

166
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,075
He tries hard to get back into the job market, but...

167
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,106
I can't even evaluate it, it's too crappy.

168
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,116
Thanks to Yeol Chan, who is getting right back at Man Sik,

169
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:04,785
Man Sik is struggling every day.

170
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:08,015
He tries to make peace with Yeol Chan in his own way.

171
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:12,155
There is no relationship that is entirely bad.

172
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:15,356
Will Man Sik be able to sort out...

173
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:16,895
this terrible relationship?

174
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:21,395
She's a boxer who loves to eat.

175
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:22,996
She's crazy from the first day, but she loves justice.

176
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,835
Here's the justice warrior and an intern, Lee Tae Lee.

177
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,965
Nice to meet you all!

178
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,376
I'm Tae Lee, Lee Tae Lee!

179
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:31,606
She's a very bright and confident character.

180
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:35,676
How she comes off may leave you to think,

181
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:38,986
how did someone like her get a job at such a big company?

182
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:41,356
But she's just very unique...

183
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:44,626
and she works very hard.

184
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,126
I'm the queen of the copy machine.

185
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,796
People say that there's a way for those who try their best...

186
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:50,196
in everything they do, no matter how small the task is.

187
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,166
She tries to comfort herself, but the real world is a cold one.

188
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:56,936
I feel like I'm just going to end up copying forever.

189
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,705
Eating is her way of de-stressing.

190
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,936
Meet the queen of eating, Lee Tae Lee!

191
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:03,775
This is absolutely delicious.

192
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:06,446
- Boy, can you eat. - It's delicious.

193
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,376
Tae Lee is...

194
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:11,686
someone who's very careful with her words.

195
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,215
And here's her superior that just began picking on her,

196
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:16,756
seemingly having no idea of what kind of a person she is.

197
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,126
Can you get me lunch?

198
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,486
Yes, sir.

199
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,496
This is somewhat acceptable, but...

200
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:24,566
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,526
I suddenly really want sundae soup.

202
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,335
It's not just once, nor twice.

203
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:32,636
Isn't it a little too much to change the menu three times?

204
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,835
That's Lee Tae Lee,

205
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,436
just trying to get by at work.

206
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:40,906
Meet Namgung Joon Soo. He's the Joon Soo of Joonsoo Food,

207
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:43,115
and he's the rich CEO of Joonsoo Food.

208
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:46,516
We also have Joonsoo Ramyeon,

209
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:48,386
and I'm the Joonsoo in that.

210
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,186
Joon Soo is someone who does what he wants.

211
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:51,855
He does whatever he wants to do,

212
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,386
says whatever he wants to say,

213
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:55,325
eats whatever he wants to eat,

214
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,595
and sleeps whenever he wants to.

215
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:59,666
As you can see, in that sense,

216
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:02,995
you'd think, what kind of a lunatic is that?

217
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:06,906
He's the son of a rich conglomerate family, but also a lunatic.

218
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:10,676
I'm the only one without any shares that's from a conglomerate family.

219
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:11,745
You!

220
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:12,745
Come on.

221
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:16,215
If it's because of the tax, I have a plan.

222
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,115
You and I...

223
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:22,115
can get married to a Monaco woman.

224
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:25,186
What nonsense are you talking about?

225
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,656
Did you know?

226
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:29,855
There are people who die from eating chili peppers too spicy.

227
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,125
Stop it!

228
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,296
Are you having fun?

229
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:36,136
He pushes the chairman's buttons every time he speaks,

230
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,595
so obviously, he's far from being the chairman's favorite.

231
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:38,666
You!

232
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,436
To beat General Manager Ga Yeol Chan,

233
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:43,406
he tries to fight his battles...

234
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,845
Even if you're a general manager,

235
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:47,276
I can't let you have this.

236
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,416
If that's what you say.

237
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,485
The more they fight, the more we get to enjoy their beautiful faces.

238
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,186
He's a gentleman...

239
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,186
and is very sweet.

240
00:09:58,186 --> 00:09:59,786
He's a really good person in real life,

241
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:01,995
and that shows through his acting.

242
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:05,595
That's why I really wanted to work with him once again.

243
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,335
Meet Tak Jung Eun, a five-year contract employee,

244
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:10,796
who's in love with Yeol Chan.

245
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,005
She wants to become a regular employee,

246
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:15,306
so she works very hard,

247
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,946
and she secretly loves...

248
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:19,676
General Manager Ga.

249
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:22,345
That means that everyone else...

250
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,615
that's not Yeol Chan is out of sight.

251
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:25,745
Mr. Lee Man Sik.

252
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:28,585
He's Mr. Lee Man Sik. How else do we address him?

253
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:31,286
She easily looks down on the old senior intern.

254
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:33,325
Nice to meet you!

255
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:36,625
And she also easily looks down on her young intern.

256
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:38,796
She's always very strict to her interns,

257
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:41,965
in fear that they may take her spot as the regular employee.

258
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,965
Not only does she count the times they go to the bathroom,

259
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,166
she even records all the coffee that they take.

260
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,436
Her hobby is definitely creepy to say the least.

261
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:52,776
When someone does well,

262
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:55,615
she gets scared and observes from afar.

263
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,446
She even writes things down.

264
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:02,686
I think that's the side of her that really resembles myself.

265
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,355
I understand why I've been casted this role.

266
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:07,656
My motto is to be a grown-up, not a kkondae.

267
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:11,196
The bloody survival begins now.

268
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:12,796
People really don't change.

269
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:13,796
Yes.

270
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,196
How can people change easily?

271
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:18,136
Will the kkondae and youngsters...

272
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,806
be able to grow up and learn to understand each other?

273
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,835
Where are your manners to your superior?

274
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,306
Yes, sir.

275
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:28,446
(Kkondae Intern Resume Review)

276
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:31,316
General Manager Ga, please show us.

277
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,546
Meet Park Hae Jin. Just him being in sight is...

278
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:37,186
an employee benefit in itself.

279
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,855
You know nothing, how dare you even say anything?

280
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:43,825
Meet Kim Eung Soo the stereotypical kkondae.

281
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,796
Nice to meet you!

282
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,266
Tae Lee, I'm Lee Tae Lee.

283
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,266
Meet Han Ji Eun. Watch out, we don't know what she'll do next.

284
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,636
Why is there nothing bad about him?

285
00:11:52,636 --> 00:11:56,306
Meet Park Ki Woong, the definition of a good man.

286
00:11:56,406 --> 00:11:57,505
Mr. Lee Man Sik.

287
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,845
Please bring four cups of coffee to the conference room.

288
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:01,345
And last but not least, Park Ah In,

289
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,745
whose boldness leaves even the kkondae speechless.

290
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,416
Do you know me?

291
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,286
What we want to know about is their past.

292
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,686
What did you just say?

293
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,926
We can't hold in our curiosity.

294
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:16,325
Let's go and take a good look at their resume.

295
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:18,026
(Let's look into their past through their resume.)

296
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:20,495
We've looked into everyone's resume,

297
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:23,536
and one person stood out in particular.

298
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,536
That's me.

299
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:26,835
That's Hae Jin, playing the role...

300
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:29,436
of Ga Yeol Chan, the true example of a superior in a company.

301
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:30,906
When I become a boss,

302
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:33,105
I will have team gatherings during work.

303
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:35,176
He's a perfect man, more perfect than perfection.

304
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,975
Tell me, where can anyone find a boss like me?

305
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:39,416
Of all of this,

306
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,016
the most perfect thing about him is his face.

307
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:44,556
You're so handsome!

308
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,625
Even this perfect-looking man has...

309
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,696
an issue of his own.

310
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,125
- I hear that you looked old... - Yes.

311
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,766
all throughout until middle school.

312
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,666
Yes, my face now is exactly how it was back then.

313
00:12:56,436 --> 00:12:59,235
I've finally reached the age where my face makes sense.

314
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,005
I look forward to being considered to look young in the future.

315
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:03,005
Who cares if you look too old or too young?

316
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,605
You're handsome, anyway.

317
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,276
The first role that he ever took on...

318
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,475
was Yeon Ha Nam, a younger man in love.

319
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:12,946
He let himself known to people with his role as Ha Nam.

320
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:16,416
You're like a new person now.

321
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,225
And his face became more and more known.

322
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,796
Talks about his handsome face even reached China.

323
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:22,855
Not only that...

324
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:25,526
You're way too tall for me.

325
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:26,766
He's 188cm tall,

326
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,266
meaning that he can make anywhere a runway.

327
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,335
Just about anything he wears...

328
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:32,965
miraculously transforms into a work of art.

329
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:35,276
He has great chemistry...

330
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:38,245
with anyone beside him.

331
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,176
He even has great chemistry with Yang Se Hyeong.

332
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:43,646
Why are you doing this to me?

333
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:47,316
He made quite an impression in every work he was in.

334
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:51,215
In particular, he really let himself become well-known...

335
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:54,625
as Yoo Jeong.

336
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,156
Seol!

337
00:13:56,156 --> 00:13:57,156
Let's eat lunch together.

338
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,465
Would you like to eat with me?

339
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,196
He's the best senior of all seniors,

340
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:02,235
a handsome senior who buys food for his juniors.

341
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:03,896
He surely stole everyone's hearts with that one.

342
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,505
He really shined as Yoo Jeong,

343
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:08,276
whose name is as beautiful as he is.

344
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:11,375
Mom, rise and shine.

345
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,605
Wake up.

346
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,776
He even got to act as a husband as sweet as Choi Soo Jong,

347
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:18,585
making everyone wish that they were married to him.

348
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:20,845
What's surprising is...

349
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:24,926
that he's not just sweet in dramas.

350
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:27,625
- You're known for your good deeds. - Good deeds?

351
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,455
Hae Jin is even sweet in real life.

352
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:32,365
Hae Jin is bringing such positive influence everywhere.

353
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,536
Since 2011, you have donated...

354
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,495
a total of 1.7 million dollars.

355
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:40,406
He never hesitates to donate.

356
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:44,436
He even participated in the thumbs-up challenge recently.

357
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,446
If any acts of kindness are needed,

358
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:48,845
you can count on him to be there.

359
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,416
But it's too early to be amazed.

360
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,845
3,000K is a good level for a background light.

361
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:55,115
- What's 3,000K? - 3,000K?

362
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:56,786
Is that the name of a new rapper?

363
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,156
It stands for Kelvin,

364
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,755
which is a measurement of the temperature of the color.

365
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:04,095
3,000K is enough to feel warmth in the room.

366
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:06,196
His face is handsome, his heart is good,

367
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,965
and even his brain is smart.

368
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:08,965
Who is he?

369
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:12,136
He's truly the man who has it all, who doesn't lack in anything.

370
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:14,235
I take a ruler around with me.

371
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,205
Look at him show off his favorite accessory.

372
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,575
I'm an analog person.

373
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:19,505
- What's that? - I take a ruler around with me.

374
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:20,845
What kind of a ruler is that?

375
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:23,016
He's truly extraordinary.

376
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:26,316
Even his accessories are interesting.

377
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,085
Do you take that ruler around with you everywhere?

378
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:30,186
- It's in my bag. - You have it in your bag?

379
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,455
Why do you do that?

380
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:34,085
I have a habit of wanting to measure everything.

381
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,095
I see.

382
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:37,125
And what he wanted to measure...

383
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,595
happened to be Yang Se Hyeong's height.

384
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:39,926
The more you get to know him,

385
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:41,896
the more you will like this perfect man.

386
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:43,365
Everything will be fine from now on.

387
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:46,936
We can't wait to see how perfectly he will pull off...

388
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,075
his character in "Kkondae Intern".

389
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,276
Listen to the elderly, you brat.

390
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,046
He's a typical Korean kkondae type.

391
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,475
What kind of punk comes to work later than his superior?

392
00:15:57,575 --> 00:16:01,085
He's the type of person you want to avoid the most.

393
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:04,485
Kim Eung Soo portrayed a typical kkondae very well.

394
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,325
But there's a two-syllable word...

395
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,755
that Eung Soo has always hated.

396
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:11,455
I don't want to be a kkondae.

397
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,465
Eung Soo insists that he hates kkondaes.

398
00:16:14,465 --> 00:16:16,036
Does he really?

399
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,306
We got very curious.

400
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:20,406
So we looked into his past.

401
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:24,536
I couldn't see you the whole day. What do you think you're doing?

402
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,906
There's one strong evidence that supports that he's a born kkondae.

403
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,075
It's his voice.

404
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:29,646
Are you kidding me?

405
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,886
His specialty is speaking like a kkondae.

406
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:35,485
Everyone can make a mistake when they throw a ball.

407
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:38,686
How could you not dodge it and get that on your eye? You idiot.

408
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,926
The characters he has played also support the theory.

409
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:44,625
He's played only characters like a traitor and gangster.

410
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,865
Corrupted prosecutor at best.

411
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:49,566
Do you think I haven't been a gangster?

412
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,595
Whether he's alive or not...

413
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,705
He's an all-time axis of evil who likes to harass others.

414
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:57,776
There had been numerous victims.

415
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,446
How dare you!

416
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,946
And sadly, most of them were pretty boys.

417
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,275
Even when he sees the heartbreaking sight of...

418
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:04,576
pretty boys bleeding and falling, he says,

419
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:07,715
What kind of a man has anemia? Shame on you.

420
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:09,755
He plays horrible villains with evil tongues.

421
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:12,326
Still, one of the characters he played was much beloved.

422
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:13,485
I'll take it and double it.

423
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:16,396
Kwak Cheol Yong of "Tazza" has become popular belatedly.

424
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,696
Sir, I think there will be heavy traffic on Olympic-daero.

425
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:21,065
Did Mapo Bridge collapse, you moron?

426
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:23,636
One morning,

427
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:27,305
it was the world of Iron Dragon.

428
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,475
He translated the name, Cheol Yong, to a more international name...

429
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:30,805
with a middle-aged man's sense of humor.

430
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:32,876
- Cheol Yong. - I didn't get that joke.

431
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:37,376
If you're asked to star in the fourth movie of "Tazza"...

432
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,386
I won't do it.

433
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:40,285
Against our expectations, his answer was a flat no.

434
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:41,285
(What's the reason?)

435
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,785
No sequels are better than the original one.

436
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:45,886
And above all, my character, Kwak Cheol Yong, is dead.

437
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:49,156
He got cranky because they mentioned the dead character, Cheol Yong.

438
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,255
They can always make a twin brother.

439
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:52,465
That won't be fun.

440
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:56,166
This isn't enough to say that Eung Soo is a kkondae.

441
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,406
Is there a dance routine that was popular back then?

442
00:17:58,406 --> 00:17:59,535
Jinjinbara?

443
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,705
Jinjinbari.

444
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:02,775
Does that mean something?

445
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,176
No, it doesn't. It's just an onomatopoeia.

446
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:06,805
This dance reflects my resentment.

447
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:09,176
Is he going to do some exorcism dance?

448
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,745
Hello, guys.

449
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:13,146
I'm Kim Eung Soo.

450
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,255
Jinjinbari, jinjinbari

451
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:17,656
This cute middle-aged man...

452
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:20,455
is the real Kim Eung Soo.

453
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:22,455
You got yourself free drinks with this?

454
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:26,366
He said he would never do the jinjinbari dance again.

455
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,326
- Jinjinbari. - That's right.

456
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:30,166
(Jinjinbari, jinjinbari)

457
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,196
(Oh! Oh!)

458
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:32,705
But when he's asked to do the dance, he does his best.

459
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,666
He's a born dancer.

460
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:39,146
When I died, I died very comfortably.

461
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:42,775
The great dancer, Kim Eung Soo, showed his talent...

462
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:45,015
in dramas as well.

463
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,386
At the moment of death, he showed his presence...

464
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,215
with the butterfly dance.

465
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,386
Here's what the dance implied.

466
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:54,725
It means one lets go of all his power...

467
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:55,795
only at the moment of their death.

468
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:58,396
- And... - You sound like Kim Yong Ok.

469
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,495
I told you we are relatives.

470
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:02,896
- "Hence!" - But...

471
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:07,765
Flustered, Eung Soo starts to say random things.

472
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:11,975
My face then was that of a sleeping baby.

473
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,446
Now a baby?

474
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,946
A very nice baby.

475
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:19,285
- You acted a baby. - Of course.

476
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,586
- Could you show us the baby's face? - The baby's face.

477
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:22,785
There's no expression on the face.

478
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:25,116
A sleeping baby doesn't make any facial expressions.

479
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:26,156
He looks so calm.

480
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,755
He doesn't look like a baby at peace,

481
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,356
but Kwak Cheol Yong at peace.

482
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,225
Somehow, all the movies and dramas I chose to shoot end up successful.

483
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,725
People say I'm lucky.

484
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,265
But I have my standards.

485
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:37,565
Of course. That's what we asked.

486
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:38,606
Let me tell you.

487
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,106
It's my gut feeling.

488
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:42,735
The shocking truth is revealed. His secret was his gut feeling.

489
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:43,936
I was expecting a more logical answer.

490
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:45,205
Are you laughing at me?

491
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:47,975
We can't laugh at the irreplaceable actor,

492
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:49,376
Kim Eung Soo's gut feeling though.

493
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:51,146
It's almost not too much to say...

494
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,715
that he's the one who raises viewer ratings.

495
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:56,086
Come on, guys! You're flattering me!

496
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,626
In 2020, the viewer rating raiser, Kim Eung Soo,

497
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,055
will turn into a kkondae.

498
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:03,555
Let's see how successful it will be this time.

499
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,765
Hello, I'm Lee Tae Lee.

500
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,025
That's right.

501
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,535
Lee Tae Lee, as in Italy.

502
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:13,535
She makes a shocking appearance.

503
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:15,876
- Boy, can you eat. - It's delicious.

504
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:18,176
She's a wacky new employee...

505
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,406
who only eats at work.

506
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,376
Who is she?

507
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:24,975
We are very curious to know her past.

508
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:30,356
"Miss Granny" is a romance movie where a grandma gets her youth back.

509
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:34,156
And Han Ji Eun starred in this movie.

510
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:39,265
She used to express her rock spirit with her vibrato.

511
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:40,765
Her past is pretty shocking.

512
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:44,666
What's even more shocking is...

513
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,465
Your name is the worst.

514
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:48,035
Ban Ji Ha.

515
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:51,576
Ban Ji Ha means basement. So how can his band see the light?

516
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:53,805
Having no idea her name would be Italy,

517
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:55,745
she quit rock and transferred to hip-hop.

518
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:57,346
This time, I put kkakdugi in ramyeon

519
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:59,086
This time, I put a chicken neck in ramyeon

520
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,646
This time, I put a drumstick in ramyeon

521
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:04,086
Whether it's rock or hip-hop, she can pull off anything...

522
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:05,785
with her patience.

523
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:07,856
I put pupae in ramyeon

524
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:10,926
Stop it. I hate your voice.

525
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,366
There's more.

526
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,626
To our surprise, she was on a Korean action zombie movie.

527
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:16,166
She didn't play a zombie though.

528
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,336
She played a well-behaved Crown Princess.

529
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,636
It's difficult to tell that they are the same actress.

530
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:20,936
She's a woman of thousand faces.

531
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:23,176
This time, she's turned into a cheerful intern.

532
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:25,906
Kkondaes know nothing about ombre hair.

533
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:29,176
She's a poor intern who had to say everything she had to say...

534
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:31,245
to kkondaes and ended up being in big trouble.

535
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:34,446
Lee Man Sik, you punk!

536
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:38,015
Will Lee Man Sik end up being murdered by this character?

537
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:41,455
If you want to see what happens to her, don't miss an episode.

538
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:42,755
Hey.

539
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,656
What's the big deal about the permanent position?

540
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,866
I'm the boss here.

541
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:48,896
He's born to a rich family...

542
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,765
and everyone envies him.

543
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:54,336
He's got everything but one thing.

544
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:56,576
If it's because of the tax, I have a plan.

545
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:58,646
You and I...

546
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,606
can get married to a Monaco woman.

547
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:05,176
In Monaco, there's no gift tax nor inheritance tax.

548
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:07,946
What nonsense are you talking about?

549
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:10,015
Because of his simple brain,

550
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:12,386
he fell out of favor with his father.

551
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,856
If you take a look at his past,

552
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:16,455
you wouldn't believe how he ended up like this.

553
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,926
In Andong, Park Ki Woong was...

554
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:21,096
- So he's from Andong. - a king.

555
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:24,596
With his handsome face, he's become the king of Andong.

556
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:26,606
How dare you.

557
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,606
He's born with a king's face.

558
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:30,076
That's why he's been playing...

559
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,775
crown princes or...

560
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:34,906
You don't regret that you're engaged to me, do you?

561
00:22:34,906 --> 00:22:37,215
sons of millionaires who are going to take over a major corporation.

562
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:42,255
He's got not only a gorgeous face but also gorgeous language skills.

563
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:44,356
I will make history.

564
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:46,485
Good luck with carrying out your idiotic mission.

565
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,555
He even pulled off the North Korean dialect.

566
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:52,565
I will show the Northern rock spirit to the South!

567
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:55,465
He ambitiously shows his North Korean rock spirit.

568
00:22:55,465 --> 00:23:00,705
(Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do)

569
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:07,106
(Do, ti, la, sol, fa, mi, re, do)

570
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:12,116
There were four handsome boys in my school.

571
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:15,186
- In Andong. - Yes, but I wasn't one of them.

572
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,285
Really?

573
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:17,815
- You weren't 1 of the 4? - Because you were the best?

574
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,356
I was just known as Park Ki Woong.

575
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,856
Ki Woong doesn't need any epithets.

576
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,096
And his name is always searched with a certain word.

577
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:27,965
When he heard Ki Woong would be here,

578
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:29,495
he mentioned the millstone dance.

579
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,495
You do that often, don't you?

580
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:32,305
I do it every time I'm on a variety show.

581
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,366
It never gets edited out, does it?

582
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:36,336
Never.

583
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,376
Could you show us the dance?

584
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,475
Please do your best.

585
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:41,005
That's right.

586
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:43,446
Ki Woong is the legendary millstone man...

587
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,916
who took over the whole nation with his dance moves.

588
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,045
(2014 version of the millstone dance)

589
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,116
He's Andong's handsome man...

590
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:52,225
and at the same time a flippant millstone guy.

591
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:55,995
Ki Woong is finally in his element on Kkondae Intern.

592
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:58,765
I knew he would make a big problem one day.

593
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:01,765
Ki Woong is going to make a big problem this time.

594
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,836
Please keep an eye on him.

595
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:05,636
How should we address you?

596
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:08,106
Mr. Intern Lee Man Sik? Or Mr. Lee Man Sik?

597
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,106
Mr. Lee Man Sik.

598
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:12,676
She's a bold woman who can call Mr. Lee Man Sik, Mr. Lee Man Sik.

599
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:15,616
He's Mr. Lee Man Sik. How else do we address him?

600
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,076
She's a forthright woman whom even Hong Gil Dong would envy.

601
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:19,946
She's Park Ah In.

602
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:21,215
Mr. Lee Man Sik.

603
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,715
Please bring four cups of coffee to the conference room.

604
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:26,025
She teaches a lesson...

605
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:27,586
to the kkondae intern who cares a lot about hierarchy.

606
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:30,055
Let's check out Park An In's past.

607
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:34,225
Women who look like they would be great at getting refunds...

608
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:36,735
are called the refund squad.

609
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:40,265
You're making a big mistake. Do you know who I am?

610
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:41,636
Let go of me already!

611
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:44,676
A proud member of the refund squad, Park Jun Geum was challenged...

612
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:47,106
by this bold woman.

613
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:48,916
Gosh, you surprised me.

614
00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:52,315
Did you send gangsters to the wedding?

615
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:55,285
Woo Jae got a surgery!

616
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,686
She's got a lot of nerves to yell at the scary Park Jun Geum.

617
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:59,586
Do you know what you did?

618
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:01,586
You ruined a person's life.

619
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:04,295
She even made her speechless with her charisma.

620
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,696
The doctor said that.

621
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:08,965
With the experience she has,

622
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,535
she's become the kkondae intern's mean superior.

623
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:13,305
What's wrong, Mr. Lee Man Sik?

624
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:15,676
Do you have problems with making coffee?

625
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:19,406
She deals with the worst kkondae by being a kkondae herself.

626
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:22,646
What's the matter?

627
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,616
What are you doing with the package? It's gross.

628
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:26,146
Throw that away and make a new one.

629
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:28,785
They have a neck-and-neck kkondae competition.

630
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,255
What did you write there?

631
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,086
She even swears elegantly using only consonants.

632
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,725
She and the kkondae intern make us wonder who the winner will be.

633
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:38,626
Can I be honest?

634
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:41,295
Honestly, from Donating Angel to Iron Dragon,

635
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:44,995
no cast in the past has been better than this.

636
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:48,735
Kkondae Intern actors worked until their noses bled.

637
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:50,836
If you are curious about the unpredictable plot,

638
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:53,505
make sure you tune in.

639
00:25:53,505 --> 00:25:55,616
Go for it!

640
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:59,346
(Kkondae Intern: Behind the Scenes)

641
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:00,386
(First script reading of Kkondae Intern)

642
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:02,146
In February, when winter was coming to an end,

643
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:05,116
the first script reading for "Kkondae Intern" took place.

644
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,785
Park Hae Jin, who plays Ga Yeol Chan,

645
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:10,126
takes out his laptop as soon as he arrives.

646
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,426
Han Ji Eun, who plays Intern Lee Tae Lee,

647
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:14,866
changed her hairstyle to suit her character.

648
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,596
She's not used to it yet.

649
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,265
Don't I look like a punk?

650
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:19,705
Can she go to work like this?

651
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:20,705
I know.

652
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,836
It's a liberal company.

653
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,076
The kkondae intern of a liberal company,

654
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,005
Kim Eung Soo is here as well.

655
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,916
It's an office drama, so according to positions in a company,

656
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:32,515
there are both experienced and young actors.

657
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:34,846
The age groups of the actors are diverse.

658
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:36,285
I'll try my best.

659
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:38,215
(Kim Eung Soo, playing Lee Man Sik)

660
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:40,626
I'm Park Hae Jin, playing Ga Yeol Chan. I'll try my best.

661
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:44,295
Hello, I'm Han Ji Eun, playing Lee Tae Lee.

662
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:47,025
I look forward to working with you. Let's do this!

663
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:50,166
I'm going to rely on the actors a lot.

664
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:54,505
We'll be fine as long as I do well.

665
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,176
Is this really their first time meeting?

666
00:26:57,176 --> 00:27:00,106
The actors are passionate about their roles already.

667
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:02,616
What do you like?

668
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:04,076
You need me!

669
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:06,045
It has to be me!

670
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:08,045
Are you sure that you can work for me?

671
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:09,515
What's wrong with that?

672
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:11,285
You can try persisting.

673
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:14,586
The worst kkondae senior is working under me now?

674
00:27:14,586 --> 00:27:17,326
Their roles have switched. It's a satisfying office comedy.

675
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:21,225
Hae Jin and Eung Soo show perfect chemistry.

676
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,235
They also take strict preventative measures...

677
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:25,436
against COVID-19.

678
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:29,606
You can get a peek before "Kkondae Intern" airs.

679
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,106
This is the behind-the-scenes.

680
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:33,146
It's all-exclusive.

681
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,676
(Guide Book of Kkondae Intern, When I Was Young)

682
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:42,285
When he was a rookie, he permed his hair,

683
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:46,985
but he wears well-fitted suits with fancy ties now.

684
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:49,525
Is this the runway?

685
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:52,156
Hae Jin shows off his model walk.

686
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:53,866
Okay!

687
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:58,065
I tried to stick to the script.

688
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,505
This is not a spoiler,

689
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,106
but I made Hotdaki.

690
00:28:01,106 --> 00:28:03,406
That's what I tell myself.

691
00:28:03,735 --> 00:28:08,245
He made it with his heart and soul.

692
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:10,946
It's mascot Hotdaki.

693
00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:15,116
It's a strange mix of ramyeon and chicken.

694
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:18,416
When it was first revealed, people showed interest.

695
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:22,755
Meanwhile, Hae Jin and Hotdaki practice a scene together.

696
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:24,955
- We can do this. - Yes?

697
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,225
- Right. Left. - Right. Left.

698
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:28,866
Hotdaki's has to block General Manager Ga.

699
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:31,866
It's an important job. Can he do it?

700
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:34,106
Filming finally starts.

701
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:35,305
You have to come.

702
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:36,775
You have to come.

703
00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:38,876
He didn't have the right timing, so it's a blooper.

704
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:42,616
Hotdaki, can you do it this time?

705
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,116
Oh, dear.

706
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:47,346
It's a blooper again, but Hae Jin finds him cute.

707
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:48,886
Chicken!

708
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:51,755
Hotdaki appears at the right time.

709
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:54,086
He tries his best.

710
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,495
It's good this time.

711
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,196
There are partners with chemistry...

712
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,565
as good as Hae Jin and Hotdaki.

713
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:05,035
- Cue! - Hae Jin and Eung Soo met...

714
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,705
for the first time on "Kkondae Intern".

715
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:08,705
Cue.

716
00:29:08,735 --> 00:29:10,735
Hae Jin has challenged himself by acting in multiple genres,

717
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:13,505
and he showed delicate emotions.

718
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:15,745
You young brats!

719
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:16,916
"I'll take double!"

720
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,446
Eung Soo has gained popularity from an old movie.

721
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:21,785
The cast themselves caught people's attention.

722
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:22,785
(Spitting)

723
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,186
- Again. - You didn't even look.

724
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:27,626
Do I have to look?

725
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,626
Again. Again. Again.

726
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:30,755
Never mind.

727
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:32,965
Don't do anything.

728
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:36,396
They're cold to each other in the drama.

729
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:38,965
Why are you doing this to me?

730
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:40,305
Cut, okay.

731
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:45,106
On set, they look at each other with affection in their eyes.

732
00:29:46,176 --> 00:29:48,775
We have an unexpected bromance.

733
00:29:50,076 --> 00:29:51,616
When he waves,

734
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:53,386
he gives a thumbs up.

735
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:55,686
Their characters are opposite extremes of each other,

736
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,856
but they're both sweet.

737
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:00,426
They have a fist fight in this scene,

738
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:01,826
but they take care of each other...

739
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:03,525
so that nobody gets hurt.

740
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:08,495
They made everybody laugh on set with their irresistible chemistry.

741
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,866
It's great.

742
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:14,606
He sometimes does things that are unexpected.

743
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:18,636
I didn't know what to do in the beginning.

744
00:30:19,146 --> 00:30:21,946
What did he do that got Hae Jin flustered?

745
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,045
What is he looking for?

746
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:27,515
He found massage balls, and he's very satisfied.

747
00:30:28,215 --> 00:30:31,815
He uses a massage stick and improvises this time.

748
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:32,826
(It's stuck.)

749
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:34,626
Again.

750
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,096
- It didn't work. - It went in.

751
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:41,826
Eung Soo's ad-lib was so natural.

752
00:30:41,826 --> 00:30:45,196
Hae Jin is used to him now.

753
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:47,965
That went in well.

754
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,876
He's being a great kkondae.

755
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,705
I'm surprised all the time.

756
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,406
Hae Jin is a kkondae.

757
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:55,245
Maybe...

758
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:58,646
he's been a kkondae throughout his life.

759
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:01,485
I'm suspicious. That's how good he is.

760
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:04,686
That's not the only thing Hae Jin is good at.

761
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:07,826
In the drama, Intern Lee Man Sik...

762
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:11,455
has to expertly open the beer bottles.

763
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:13,525
It's not easy at first,

764
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:17,696
so General Manager Ga or Hae Jin steps up to the plate.

765
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:19,666
Face this way and flick up.

766
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:21,106
Like this?

767
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:24,636
He has an odd talent.

768
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:26,846
- I can do it. Should I try? - Sure.

769
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:30,815
However, it's not as easy as it looks.

770
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:32,985
Here's a fill-in for bottle opening...

771
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:34,846
you'll never see again in Korean dramas.

772
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,285
I can...

773
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:38,555
You can tell from the sound that he's an expert.

774
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:40,955
You can take over.

775
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:44,795
As a substitute for Eung Soo, he flaunts his skill.

776
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:47,295
He can use any tool to open beer bottles.

777
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:48,896
They keep cheering.

778
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:52,295
It's a tough job being a cameraman.

779
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:54,965
Lee Man Sik is a kkondae as a general manager,

780
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:58,576
but young General Manager Ga is also a kkondae.

781
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:01,846
For everybody watching "Kkondae Intern",

782
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:04,015
you'll go, "That's me."

783
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:06,646
You'll be able to relate here and there...

784
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:09,386
in this drama.

785
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,356
Besides Lee Man Sik played by Eung Soo,

786
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:12,886
there are two more that form an intern trio.

787
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:14,455
Lee Tae Lee is played by Han Ji Eun,

788
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:16,626
and Joo Yoon Soo is played by Ro Jong Hyun.

789
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:20,426
On their first day at work, you can see their personalities.

790
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:21,965
I look forward to working with you!

791
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,596
Tae Lee, Tae Lee, Lee Tae Lee!

792
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,166
Yoon Soo, Yoon Soo, Joo... Excuse me.

793
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,805
We made it.

794
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:31,705
- I knew it. - I don't know why we both made it.

795
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:33,346
I don't understand.

796
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:36,015
I think I'm slightly better.

797
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:37,676
In what ways?

798
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,686
Because I'm Lee Tae Lee.

799
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:43,686
Man Sik doesn't have a choice.

800
00:32:43,856 --> 00:32:47,126
Man Sae is in elementary school. If he wants to send him to college,

801
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,755
he has to exert himself.

802
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:49,795
However...

803
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:51,455
These are not the employees I want.

804
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:53,926
The interns don't know what their general manager thinks.

805
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:56,196
They're simply excited on their first day.

806
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:59,735
Their work life is going to be a struggle.

807
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:02,775
Maybe she doesn't know that.

808
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:06,376
From the first day on set, Ji Eun boosts the atmosphere.

809
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:09,446
Tae Lee is a bright and cheerful character.

810
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,245
Can you see the resemblance with Ji Eun?

811
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:15,886
The resemblance is about half.

812
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:18,285
I think it's 50, 50.

813
00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:21,856
The resemblance is the easy-going, bright side of her.

814
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:24,696
The difference is her intolerance for injustice.

815
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:27,166
You'll know when you watch the drama,

816
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,795
but there were times...

817
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:32,265
when she goes overboard.

818
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,205
She says what needs to be said.

819
00:33:34,436 --> 00:33:37,076
More than anything, she's 100 percent like Tae Lee...

820
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:38,936
in that she loves to eat.

821
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:43,646
Both when the camera is on and off, she couldn't stop eating.

822
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:47,015
I can't help it. I'll gain weight because of this.

823
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:48,686
Can I have this?

824
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:50,686
Can I eat this too?

825
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:53,156
She's totally used to her character's eating habit.

826
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:55,285
I always come on set to eat.

827
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:57,525
Watching her eat stimulates your appetite.

828
00:33:57,525 --> 00:33:58,755
She's adorable when she eats.

829
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:02,465
I hope you discover Ji Eun's new charm.

830
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:07,435
Let me introduce three senior employees...

831
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:09,775
who show great chemistry with General Manager Ga.

832
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:13,375
You have the ability to look into the future. I admire you.

833
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:15,206
His specialty is flattering his seniors,

834
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:17,446
and his hobby is dumping work on his juniors.

835
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,685
Ko Gun Han plays Oh Dong Geun.

836
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,585
He obviously is an annoying character,

837
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:24,255
but he is merely trying to survive at work.

838
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:26,286
Many will be able to relate to him.

839
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:29,496
Assistant Manager Oh Dong Geun talks too much.

840
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,996
Everything he says is nonsense.

841
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:32,596
Hong Seung Bum plays Kim Seung Jin...

842
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:34,766
who recently became a full-time employee.

843
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:37,895
He turns from a smart intern into a young kkondae.

844
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:41,806
He's a funny character that energizes everybody.

845
00:34:42,636 --> 00:34:45,576
She's been a contract worker for five years.

846
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,545
Park Ah In plays Tak Jung Eun.

847
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,746
She wants to be an employee, so she has to compete.

848
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:52,846
She's really bothered by the interns.

849
00:34:52,846 --> 00:34:57,185
Jung Eun is hostile toward them.

850
00:34:57,415 --> 00:35:00,726
Furthermore, she has a secret crush for General Manager Ga.

851
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:02,996
You'll find her peculiarly charming.

852
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:06,625
Because of that, she's always next to him.

853
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:10,036
She keeps on glancing at him and can't hide her feelings.

854
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:11,536
- Good luck! - Jung Eun!

855
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:14,005
With his support, she gives it a try,

856
00:35:14,005 --> 00:35:17,036
but she's not that good.

857
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:19,846
Then how good is Yeol Chan?

858
00:35:19,846 --> 00:35:21,206
Since his character is so perfect,

859
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,676
maybe his bowling skill is excellent as well.

860
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:25,045
Did you practice bowling?

861
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:26,485
Bowling?

862
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:29,116
You can't...

863
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:30,685
practice overnight.

864
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:34,286
You can probably tell, but he has a great physique.

865
00:35:34,286 --> 00:35:36,125
Everything about him is perfect.

866
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:39,426
Jung Eun is attracted to him as a man,

867
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:44,036
but also really looks up to him as a coworker.

868
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:47,465
And here are the four executives at the heart of the company.

869
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:50,576
It's Park Ki Woong, Kim Sun Young, Park Jong Hak, and Ko In Beom.

870
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:53,545
This one is Chairman's son,

871
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:55,746
who is rivals with Yeol Chan,

872
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,846
and is a man of impeccable sense in fashion.

873
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:00,085
His name is Namgoong Joon Soo.

874
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:02,855
We have to stop him, okay?

875
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,415
Does that sound too fake?

876
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,386
Ki Woong seems to be struggling...

877
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:09,085
to get used to these somewhat fake-looking clothes.

878
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,295
That jacket looks like it's not complete.

879
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:12,326
You're right.

880
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:14,465
Maybe you wore it inside-out.

881
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,465
The zipper is inside, too.

882
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:20,105
- That's hilarious. - I can't zip it up.

883
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:22,766
It's all a part of his character.

884
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:27,176
Even his outfits are not like those of a regular employee's.

885
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:29,005
He dresses as he'd like,

886
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,616
says whatever he wants to,

887
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:32,545
and I'm supposed to call Eung Soo...

888
00:36:32,545 --> 00:36:35,315
Mr. Lee in the drama,

889
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:38,156
but I call him brother at times.

890
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,156
Brother!

891
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:42,485
He really does whatever he wants.

892
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:46,795
You really wouldn't find anyone like him in real life.

893
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:50,065
But there's another person with quite unique fashion...

894
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,096
and that's Koo Ja Sook, played by Kim Sun Young.

895
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:54,335
Isn't this more unique?

896
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,375
Just her outfits are enough to make her steal everyone's eyes.

897
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,105
Do you not know how our Chairman looks?

898
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:00,746
Put that down!

899
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:03,846
She really shows off her charisma here.

900
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:06,516
What? Ransomware?

901
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,346
What happened?

902
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:10,886
There's also Ahn Sang Jong, played by Jong Hak,

903
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:12,815
who's in charge of the Marketing Department.

904
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:17,025
You have to use your brains, not just money!

905
00:37:17,326 --> 00:37:19,525
And then there's Go In Beom as Chairman Nam Goong Pyo.

906
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:20,795
Why are you smacking the table?

907
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,935
Not only did they lead the team through the filming,

908
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:25,596
but they add depth to the drama.

909
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:28,136
These middle-aged actors are truly the gem of the drama.

910
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:32,076
And we can't forget about the cameos.

911
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:35,105
They were only on screen for a few moments,

912
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:36,715
but Jung Sung Ho and Jang Sung Kyu really left quite an impression.

913
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,016
I love you, Tae Lee!

914
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:41,286
Lee Min Ji, who was quite a side role in "Reply 1988,"

915
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:44,116
is a cameo in the drama,

916
00:37:44,116 --> 00:37:45,956
who tries to stick up for Yeol Chan,

917
00:37:45,956 --> 00:37:48,085
but gets scolded by Man Sik instead.

918
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:50,395
Do you have a crush on him?

919
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:51,996
Do you think I'm crazy?

920
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:54,395
As if she saw what was coming...

921
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:56,866
May I put on an apron?

922
00:37:57,496 --> 00:37:59,196
I have to duck when you throw it at me.

923
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:01,366
She's trying to prepare herself, but...

924
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:02,636
Get rid of that thing right away!

925
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:07,145
But there was no way she could avoid Man Sik's anger.

926
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:09,476
I'm terrified.

927
00:38:09,476 --> 00:38:10,576
You go, too!

928
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:13,185
- Okay. - Good.

929
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:14,746
Meanwhile,

930
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:19,016
Jeong Young Ju appears as a cameo in the drama as a celebrity.

931
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:21,326
Right from the start, she put her foot down.

932
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:23,826
I'm going to be very serious.

933
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:25,156
I'm not good at being funny.

934
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:29,165
Instead of being funny, she takes a blow at Man Sik.

935
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:33,306
Aren't you curious about what happened?

936
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:38,536
Look at this cutie, getting everyone's love on the set.

937
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,076
She's so cute just sitting there,

938
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:47,045
but not only that, she barks when she's supposed to.

939
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,886
Doggie! You have to come to Mommy!

940
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:51,886
There you are.

941
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:53,525
She came out right when she was supposed to...

942
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:56,855
and even collapsed at the right timing.

943
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,766
Young Ju and the puppy really showed good chemistry,

944
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:03,335
as if they were really owner and dog.

945
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:04,596
Look at her.

946
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:06,465
We're so thankful that she's in the drama,

947
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,906
but she even sent us a greeting.

948
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:11,835
I'm taking on a very important role...

949
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:14,406
in "Kkondae Intern".

950
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:17,076
It'll be fun for you to look for me here and there...

951
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:19,246
as you watch the drama.

952
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:20,946
Please enjoy the drama.

953
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:22,815
Best of luck to "Kkondae Intern"!

954
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:27,426
The cast's great acting, heart-fluttering chemistry, and...

955
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:30,525
It's an honor to be recording a trot soundtrack for the drama...

956
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:32,395
as a trot singer.

957
00:39:32,395 --> 00:39:35,295
I'm so honored and ecstatic.

958
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,596
(Back in my days!)

959
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:41,005
When you're tired and feeling down, Young Tak is the man you need.

960
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,235
I sang with all the joy in my heart,

961
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:47,176
so I hope that you will take all the positive energy from it.

962
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:50,775
And since my voice is in the drama,

963
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:53,145
I hope that it'll feel like you are...

964
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:55,846
watching the drama with me.

965
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,726
"Kkondae Intern" is made with all the love and dedication.

966
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:01,855
This refreshing drama on the weak taking revenge...

967
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:03,755
is waiting for you!

968
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:06,226
- Thank you! - Thank you.

969
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,435
("Kkondae Intern" Highlight Previews)

970
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:14,206
Young people these days...

971
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,706
are so useless.

972
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,335
Back in my days...

973
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,505
Kkondae is a term for those who love to say, "Back in my days."

974
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,645
Imagine that annoying kkondae...

975
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,145
Hello!

976
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:27,915
I'm Senior Intern Lee Man Sik joining your team...

977
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:29,485
from today!

978
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:31,386
That annoying kkondae is now working for me.

979
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:33,726
It's finally my time.

980
00:40:33,726 --> 00:40:35,926
Here's the office life of the passionate intern...

981
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:38,726
and his superior, who gets stressed out...

982
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:40,266
because of him.

983
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:41,866
Are you sure that you can work for me?

984
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:43,136
What's wrong with that?

985
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:45,366
It's thrilling.

986
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:48,605
They never know when the line will be crossed.

987
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:50,536
What should I do?

988
00:40:50,536 --> 00:40:53,346
Absolutely nothing.

989
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:56,346
(Kkondae Intern)

990
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,815
What kind of a man passes out from anemia?

991
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:04,156
Young people these days can't do anything right.

992
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,985
From head to toe,

993
00:41:06,985 --> 00:41:08,556
this man is the epitome of kkondae.

994
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:11,696
- Hello. - Good morning.

995
00:41:11,696 --> 00:41:12,996
Sure.

996
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:15,196
He's the legendary kkondae boss,

997
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:16,996
Lee Man Sik.

998
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:19,565
Who dares to come to work after the general manager?

999
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:21,335
And there's an unfortunate man...

1000
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:23,605
who's certainly disliked by this uptight man.

1001
00:41:24,206 --> 00:41:25,275
I'm sorry.

1002
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,406
It's Ga Yeol Chan the troublemaker.

1003
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:31,116
And here begins Man Sik's bullying of Yeol Chan.

1004
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,545
Would you like some coffee?

1005
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:34,516
No, stop it!

1006
00:41:34,516 --> 00:41:36,516
How did you even get into this company?

1007
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:39,286
He says something savage at least once a day.

1008
00:41:39,386 --> 00:41:41,125
Just don't do anything.

1009
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:45,826
Again. Again!

1010
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:49,596
And of course, makes Yeol Chan do everything over and over again.

1011
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:51,696
You mean, the thing that the intern mentioned before?

1012
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:54,266
What are you talking about?

1013
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:55,806
That was my idea!

1014
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:58,005
He even steals his ideas.

1015
00:41:58,136 --> 00:41:59,375
Ga Yeol Chan.

1016
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,645
- Yes, sir. - I have some work for you.

1017
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,346
He even makes Yeol Chan do...

1018
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:05,415
his son's homework for him.

1019
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:08,346
What are you doing? You can't even drink.

1020
00:42:08,786 --> 00:42:11,156
He'd be a saint if he can last through this.

1021
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:14,826
In the end, this poor intern ends up resigning.

1022
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:16,255
I'm going to live.

1023
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:19,355
I'm going to live and show the world.

1024
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:23,096
And so, he begins preparing himself for the day he can take revenge.

1025
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,465
A few years later...

1026
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:30,375
Next up is the 200,000,000 Dollar Export Award.

1027
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:33,576
Congratulations to Ga Yeol Chan of Joonsoo Food.

1028
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:35,275
We'll continue to lead...

1029
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:37,746
the K-food trend through our Spicy Chicken brand.

1030
00:42:37,976 --> 00:42:39,045
Thank you.

1031
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:43,286
He became a general manager at the rival company.

1032
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:46,926
Congratulations to Ga Yeol Chan for being awarded...

1033
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:49,025
with the 200,000,000 Dollar Export Award!

1034
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,326
Cheers!

1035
00:42:51,755 --> 00:42:53,226
There are some rules...

1036
00:42:53,226 --> 00:42:56,025
that he makes sure to keep as a general manager.

1037
00:42:56,395 --> 00:42:58,435
Team lunches are a new trend.

1038
00:42:58,596 --> 00:42:59,866
When I become a boss,

1039
00:42:59,866 --> 00:43:02,165
I will have team gatherings during work.

1040
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,676
How lucky are we?

1041
00:43:04,906 --> 00:43:07,706
He's the boss that everyone wants.

1042
00:43:07,746 --> 00:43:09,915
One day, while he was having...

1043
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:12,545
the time of his life being the best boss ever...

1044
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:13,815
Hello!

1045
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:17,755
I'm a Senior Intern Lee Man Sik, and I am joining your team today.

1046
00:43:17,815 --> 00:43:19,886
How did you get here?

1047
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:23,556
That kkondae boss is back.

1048
00:43:23,556 --> 00:43:25,426
What happened?

1049
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:28,926
You can't just barge in like this.

1050
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:31,465
The kkondae general manager is losing his place in the company.

1051
00:43:31,636 --> 00:43:34,766
The company needs me!

1052
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:36,435
I'm irreplaceable!

1053
00:43:36,435 --> 00:43:38,875
How can you make me quit at this point?

1054
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:41,176
So, he ends up unemployed.

1055
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:44,746
You think I'll have nowhere else to go?

1056
00:43:44,746 --> 00:43:48,016
That's right, he has nowhere else to go.

1057
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:52,415
Meanwhile, there's a man...

1058
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:54,355
who's very dissatisfied with Yeol Chan's success.

1059
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:57,895
What if the company gets passed onto Ga Yeol Chan instead?

1060
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:58,956
No way.

1061
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:01,165
You need to bring me something!

1062
00:44:01,165 --> 00:44:04,235
Joon Soo is the Chairman's son, but losing his ground to Yeol Chan.

1063
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:06,706
After hours of searching through...

1064
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:10,935
This is it!

1065
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:12,735
He scouted Man Sik as a senior intern,

1066
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:15,076
knowing that Man Sik is Ga Yeol's weak point.

1067
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:17,045
- Mr. Lee Man Sik. - Yes.

1068
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:19,346
And so, they meet again,

1069
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:21,985
but this time, the tables have turned.

1070
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:23,585
Are you really okay with working for me?

1071
00:44:23,585 --> 00:44:25,855
What's wrong with that? I'm completely fine.

1072
00:44:25,855 --> 00:44:27,326
Then you better stick through.

1073
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:28,326
Sure.

1074
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:30,395
Where are your manners to your superior?

1075
00:44:30,895 --> 00:44:31,895
Yes, sir.

1076
00:44:31,895 --> 00:44:34,326
If you can't avoid it, you have to enjoy it.

1077
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:38,196
Don't you expect elderly respect or kindness.

1078
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:42,866
Yeol Chan decides to take his revenge on Man Sik.

1079
00:44:43,536 --> 00:44:46,206
Mr. Ga, would you like me to bring you a coffee?

1080
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:49,676
I'd like espresso doppio lungo...

1081
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:51,576
as a very dry cappuccino with whipped cream on top.

1082
00:44:51,576 --> 00:44:53,846
I'd also like chocolate drizzle and cinnamon powder on top.

1083
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:54,946
Here's my card.

1084
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:58,956
General Manager Ga is really taking his sweet revenge,

1085
00:44:58,956 --> 00:45:00,826
but this isn't the end.

1086
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:04,926
This is impressive, I can tell that you've had...

1087
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:06,866
30 years of experience in the field.

1088
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:09,965
He acts so kind when there are people watching, but...

1089
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:12,895
It's too old-fashioned, it's not worth reading.

1090
00:45:12,895 --> 00:45:15,165
He's savage when there are just the two of them.

1091
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:17,335
Where is your proposal, Man Sik?

1092
00:45:17,335 --> 00:45:19,875
What? This dried pollack soup ramyeon is mine.

1093
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:22,706
He also turns a blind eye on him when his idea gets stolen.

1094
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:25,346
It's cold and raining, so what do you all say...

1095
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:26,516
to some hot and spicy pizza?

1096
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:29,386
I know that he can't eat a meal without soup.

1097
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:31,056
Yeol Chan gave up...

1098
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:33,215
on being the best boss ever to take his revenge.

1099
00:45:33,585 --> 00:45:37,625
It would have been great if his immature revenge worked.

1100
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:40,395
Is that all you have? Copying me?

1101
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:42,226
You're no match for me, punk.

1102
00:45:42,665 --> 00:45:45,735
He doesn't get affected by any criticism.

1103
00:45:46,636 --> 00:45:48,105
I need you to sway General Manager Ga.

1104
00:45:48,105 --> 00:45:50,306
What can I do?

1105
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:52,906
With CEO Namgoong on his back,

1106
00:45:52,906 --> 00:45:55,875
he becomes even more thick-skinned.

1107
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,215
No relationships are completely bad.

1108
00:45:58,215 --> 00:46:00,415
Smiling while reminiscing the past...

1109
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:03,145
with whom I thought had an ill-fated relationship.

1110
00:46:03,145 --> 00:46:06,685
Rather, Yeol Chan was on the verge of breaking down.

1111
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:10,226
Man Sik, I'm treating the Chinese buyers today.

1112
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,226
Join me.

1113
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,926
Yeol Chan's revenge never stops.

1114
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:19,636
Are there no interpreters?

1115
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:23,235
Yeol Chan canceled them this morning.

1116
00:46:23,706 --> 00:46:25,906
Yeol Chan asked him to join because he doesn't know Chinese.

1117
00:46:25,906 --> 00:46:28,406
He wanted to humiliate him.

1118
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:29,775
However.

1119
00:46:33,346 --> 00:46:34,846
That man.

1120
00:46:36,855 --> 00:46:39,755
Because of this thick-skinned and clueless intern,

1121
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,355
their contract almost didn't work out, but maybe not.

1122
00:46:45,295 --> 00:46:46,656
Thanks, Man Sik.

1123
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:50,025
The buyer liked Korea's drinking culture,

1124
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:51,965
so he signs the contract.

1125
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:56,266
How did you get pushed over by that oldie?

1126
00:46:56,665 --> 00:46:59,875
It taints his reputation he worked hard to build.

1127
00:47:00,645 --> 00:47:02,775
Is General Manager Ga out of his mind?

1128
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:04,116
I know.

1129
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:05,976
- That was terrible. - Terrible?

1130
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:07,915
He instantly turns from an angel boss...

1131
00:47:07,915 --> 00:47:09,485
into a terrible one.

1132
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:12,456
Stop acting up.

1133
00:47:12,616 --> 00:47:16,085
Because of Man Sik, his life is messed up now.

1134
00:47:16,085 --> 00:47:19,755
What kind of an idiot sent ramyeon to Yeonggok Borough Office?

1135
00:47:19,996 --> 00:47:21,496
Then one day...

1136
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:23,226
I did.

1137
00:47:23,395 --> 00:47:24,636
- Is there a problem? - Oh, dear.

1138
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:26,196
The kkondae intern makes a huge mistake...

1139
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:29,165
and sends the wrong ramyeon order.

1140
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:32,906
How can you work when you can't see?

1141
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:35,706
It's 300 boxes, so our team is not enough.

1142
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:37,446
Let's go before anything happens.

1143
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:40,145
He causes trouble to all employees,

1144
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:42,145
but it ultimately gets taken care of.

1145
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:43,485
- Great work. - Thank you.

1146
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,185
- Are you crying? - I'm not.

1147
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:49,726
I feel like I'm a nuisance to the team.

1148
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:51,596
However...

1149
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:55,395
You're not a nuisance to the team. You're a stepping stone.

1150
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:58,266
What does he have in mind now?

1151
00:47:58,266 --> 00:47:59,636
This is it.

1152
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:02,105
This is the advanced way of harassing him.

1153
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:05,105
Yeol Chan turns much more immature.

1154
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:08,346
You called the angel terrible.

1155
00:48:08,346 --> 00:48:10,145
Cancel it now.

1156
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:11,976
General Manager Ga is not terrible.

1157
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,145
There's somebody else who's actually terrible.

1158
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:17,215
As he planned, his reputation improves.

1159
00:48:17,215 --> 00:48:19,286
Right as he thought he got his perfect revenge...

1160
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:21,985
against the kkondae intern...

1161
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:24,226
Man Sik, are you at the office?

1162
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:25,226
Yes?

1163
00:48:25,395 --> 00:48:26,895
I'll send you an email,

1164
00:48:26,895 --> 00:48:30,335
so please make 10 copies and bring them to the conference room.

1165
00:48:30,335 --> 00:48:33,395
Man Sik opens Yeol Chan's computer as instructed.

1166
00:48:33,395 --> 00:48:34,505
However...

1167
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:35,636
What's this?

1168
00:48:37,005 --> 00:48:40,946
He opened something he shouldn't have.

1169
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:42,176
Assistant Manager Oh.

1170
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:43,846
Delete it, Tae Lee.

1171
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:45,976
- Look. - What's this?

1172
00:48:45,976 --> 00:48:48,715
Thanks to him, all the computers get a virus.

1173
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:50,956
I'll take responsibility and quit.

1174
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:52,685
That's not taking responsibility.

1175
00:48:53,215 --> 00:48:55,085
You're running away.

1176
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:58,156
The kkondae intern surrenders.

1177
00:48:59,096 --> 00:49:02,065
You're not even half as good as Onggol.

1178
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,665
How dare you act up?

1179
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:05,895
If you like Onggol that much, get lost.

1180
00:49:05,895 --> 00:49:07,806
I'm going to go, jerk.

1181
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:10,435
Stop talking and get lost.

1182
00:49:10,676 --> 00:49:11,875
Right now!

1183
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:14,775
They're at it again.

1184
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:16,406
How many times do I have to tell you?

1185
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:18,616
- Oh, dear. - My gosh!

1186
00:49:18,616 --> 00:49:19,946
Nobody else knows,

1187
00:49:19,946 --> 00:49:23,985
but the revenge battle is raging between them.

1188
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:26,685
Kkon-tern? Who do you think I am?

1189
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:29,355
I need a more clever maneuver.

1190
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:33,096
How immature will their next revenge be?

1191
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:35,025
You never change.

1192
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:36,826
Are you still upset about what happened in the past?

1193
00:49:36,826 --> 00:49:40,165
Will the chairman notice?

1194
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:43,465
Are you curious about their amusing work life?

1195
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:45,076
I'm going to crush him.

1196
00:49:45,076 --> 00:49:46,505
I'm going to rip him apart.

1197
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:48,446
This is far from done.

1198
00:49:49,476 --> 00:49:52,476
("Kkondae Intern" premieres on May 20.)

1199
00:49:52,476 --> 00:49:54,545
Again. Again. Again.

1200
00:49:54,545 --> 00:49:56,016
Don't do anything.

1201
00:49:56,016 --> 00:49:57,286
This?

1202
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,456
Don't do anything. Get out of here!

1203
00:50:01,185 --> 00:50:02,685
How should I say this?

1204
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:05,926
He lost the trial, but he didn't accept it.

1205
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:08,965
- He said he was going to die... - Are you all right? Honey!

1206
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,125
Why are you doing this to me?

1207
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:13,196
Why the heck are you doing this to me?

1208
00:50:13,196 --> 00:50:14,406
Because you don't listen.

1209
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:15,735
I told you to mind your own business,

1210
00:50:15,735 --> 00:50:17,505
but you never listen!
