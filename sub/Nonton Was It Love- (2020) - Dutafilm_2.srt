DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA

HANKUK UNIVERSITY

6
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,414
I, Noh Ae-jeong,

7
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,041
have three outstanding qualities
you will only grow to love.

8
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,460
A, five years of delivering newspapers

9
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,505
prove my drive and constant diligence.

10
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,342
B, four years of working
as a supermarket cashier

11
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,845
exhibit how precise and meticulous I am.

12
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,555
Enjoy the movie. Hello, sir.

13
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,224
-C, I'm one to never give up...
-Please head left.

14
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,767
-...on my dreams.
-Enjoy the movie.

15
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,436
-Welcome.
-You can knock me down,

16
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,187
but I will always get up.

17
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,357
And that is why I, Noh Ae-jeong,
hope to join Korea's number one

18
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,358
film studio Ten Film...

19
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,359
Shinyi Media...

20
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,111
At Thumb Film's Accounting Department,

21
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,698
I will showcase my three traits
and deliver--

22
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,787
-I'm sorry, sir.
-We're in the middle of an interview!

23
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,080
Take it outside.

24
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,206
EPISODE 1

25
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,751
Seriously?
Have you not heard of silent mode?

26
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,377
I apologize.

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,506
Apart from part-time jobs, are you
familiar with any accounting software,

28
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,052
or programs like Microsoft Excel,
PowerPoint, or Word?

29
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:21,099
I used PowerPoint in university.

30
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,898
Right. Well, according to your resume,

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,359
you apparently dropped out of university.

32
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,445
That's right.

33
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,405
Dropped out in 2006? Hold on a second.

34
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,615
One, two...

35
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,326
How many years of study did you complete?

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,162
I dropped out
halfway through my senior year.

37
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,538
Wait, hold on a second.

38
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,249
You only had a semester left,

39
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,877
so why did you choose to drop out?

40
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,385
Was there some sort of an issue?

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,613
Ha-nee!

42
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,574
-Ma'am, you're here.
-Goodness.

43
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,702
I apologize for being late.
I couldn't get off work earlier.

44
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,954
It's all right.

45
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,289
-It's nothing, but...
-Gosh, thank you.

46
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,583
Ha-nee.

47
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,673
The truth is...

48
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,300
MY FAMILY, MOM

49
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,678
The kids must've asked
why she didn't draw her dad.

50
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,014
It's my fault
for not being attentive enough.

51
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,401
MY FAMILY, JEONG-U, DAD, MOM

52
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,613
DAD, SISTER, ME, MOM

53
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,575
Ha-nee, when your mother gets home,

54
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,952
why don't we light up a candle
and make a wish?

55
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,830
No?

56
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,957
But it's Christmas Eve.

57
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,460
You can wish Santa for something--

58
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,586
That's a lie.

59
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,963
What do you mean?

60
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,631
Santa doesn't exist.

61
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,926
Just like my dad.

62
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,682
Ha-nee, your dad is up in heaven--

63
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,892
That's a lie.

64
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,644
Why is that a lie?

65
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,984
Ha-nee,

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,530
let's just say that he died, okay?

67
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,032
Why?

68
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,283
Well,

69
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,537
your mom wants to think of it that way.

70
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,705
Why?

71
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,707
Well...

72
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,877
You see,

73
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,215
there are some people
you'd rather wish were dead.

74
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,467
You'll understand when you're older.

75
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,052
Why?

76
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,929
Well...

77
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,644
How about your mom and I promise

78
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,271
to make up for your dad?

79
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,400
What? My goodness.

80
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
DISCOUNT FOR NEW LOANS

81
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,274
Was there some sort of an issue?

82
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,444
-Ms. Noh?
-Sorry?

83
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,154
THUMB FILM EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT

84
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,074
APPLICANT: NOH AE-JEONG

85
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,286
If you have nothing else to say...

86
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,581
I became a mom.

87
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,961
I got pregnant at 23

88
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,463
and had to raise my child alone.

89
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,385
I wasn't able to continue my studies,

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,887
but I don't regret any of it.

91
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,392
Caring for my daughter wasn't easy,

92
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,438
but it was a joy to see her grow up.

93
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,108
She turned six this year.

94
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,194
Oh, I see.

95
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,365
When she was young,
I could get by on part-time jobs.

96
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,577
But she needs to start school soon

97
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,746
and I want her to dress in nice clothes.

98
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,124
-That's why I'm looking for stability--
-Right.

99
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,793
I hear you loud and clear.

100
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,670
RESUME: NOH AE-JEONG

101
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,191
Gosh!

102
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,002
In we go.

103
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,424
What's wrong?

104
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,718
What on earth happened?

105
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,970
Mom, no. Stay back.

106
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,930
Mom?

107
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,932
Ha-nee, stay back. You'll hurt yourself.

108
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,268
Mom, keep her there.

109
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,606
I lost my grip and it fell.

110
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,445
It's all my fault.

111
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,753
It's not your fault.

112
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,713
The cheap cup is to blame.

113
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,143
Just a second, Ms. Noh.

114
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,521
Why a film studio of all places?

115
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,025
Other companies have
accounting departments,

116
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,944
but you applied for a job
at a film studio.

117
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,738
That's what I want to know.

118
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,784
It's over now.

119
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,536
Wait there. I'll be right over.

120
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,917
YEAR 2006

121
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,460
Because I had a dream.

122
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,256
DIRECTED BY OH DAE-O
PRODUCED BY NOH AE-JEONG

123
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,716
Before I became a mom,

124
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,261
my dream was to become a film producer.

125
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,809
That was so cool!

126
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,144
-Congratulations.
-It was awesome.

127
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,771
That was incredible.

128
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,035
I can be asked to push pencils
for all I care.

129
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,330
Working at a film studio in any capacity
would be enough.

130
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,917
Is that important?
That dream of yours, I mean.

131
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,755
I may be barely scraping by,

132
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,758
but that hasn't changed who I am.

133
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,804
I promised myself

134
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,598
when I first learned that I was pregnant.

135
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,854
My dream, my life, and my child.
I wasn't going to give up on any of them.

136
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,567
I know it won't be easy.

137
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,277
However,

138
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,156
I want to set an example for my child.

139
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,160
I want her to see me achieve my dream.

140
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,746
What is it? Was that from
the company you interviewed for?

141
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,915
Were you hired?

142
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,002
Grandma, what does "hired" mean?

143
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,590
The silence is killing me.
Answer my question.

144
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,466
Come on.

145
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,177
Mom.

146
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,345
I'm hired.

147
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,181
They hired me.

148
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,684
-Really?
-I got in.

149
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,020
-My gosh!
-Mom?

150
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,688
-Goodness me.
-What's "hired"?

151
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,525
My gosh. Sweetie pie!

152
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,360
My adorable little puppy.

153
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,573
I can't believe it, Mom.
It's too good to be true!

154
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,617
-Goodness.
-Mom?

155
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,035
What a miracle.

156
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,000
Have you all made a wish?

157
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,376
All right, then.

158
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,088
Let's see who blows out the candles first.

159
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,009
One.

160
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,094
Two.

161
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,931
Three!

162
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,477
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas.

163
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,063
Have a good day.

164
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,523
Gosh, it looks brand new.

165
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,777
DRY CLEANING

166
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,779
MR AND MRS DRY CLEANING

167
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,625
-Look. Isn't mine adorable?
-I picked that first.

168
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,877
-No, I did.
-Come on. We'll be late for school.

169
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,379
Hurry!

170
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,061
Either you watch that or eat.

171
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,688
Stop nibbling and do one or the other.

172
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,274
Why leave the TV on
when no one's watching it?

173
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,235
Unbelievable.

174
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,654
The key to success these days
is multitasking.

175
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,949
How about I multitask on you
and smack you front and back?

176
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,996
I'm back!

177
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,749
Ta-da. Fresh from the dry cleaner's.

178
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,378
So you can start afresh at your new school

179
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,463
and keep the momentum going
until you graduate.

180
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,633
As if I'd be able to really start afresh

181
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,135
in a second-hand uniform.

182
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,179
That's rich coming from someone
who had to transfer schools

183
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,597
only one month into the semester.

184
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,640
Also, know this.

185
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,184
This will be the last time
you transfer schools.

186
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,602
Your days of swapping schools

187
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,729
are now long gone.

188
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,481
-Fine.
-This is for you.

189
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,196
-What's this?
-Your personal sandbag.

190
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,157
Don't get into trouble on your first day

191
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,910
and squeeze this hard
when you want to hit someone.

192
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,412
If that doesn't work,

193
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,582
get in their faces
and threaten them with words.

194
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,502
You call that parenting?

195
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,130
Mom, that hurts.

196
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,302
By the way, when will your company
pay your last month's salary?

197
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,638
I already told you
that it'll be wired soon.

198
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,975
Anyway, a big investor will come by

199
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,560
to hear our presentation today.

200
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,188
Is that why
you stayed up all night working?

201
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,564
Who's the director?

202
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,274
Bong Joon-ho? Park Chan-wook?

203
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,611
I can't believe you know those names.

204
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,947
What else would I expect
from a daughter of a film producer?

205
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,658
Stop changing the subject.

206
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,245
After the last film tanked,

207
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,998
most employees in the company resigned.

208
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,169
Who would this investor
even bet his money on?

209
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,046
Who else?

210
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,341
The studio's bookkeeper of eight years
who was promoted as a producer.

211
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,843
Your daughter, Noh Ae-jeong.

212
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,764
How can a bookkeeper
become a film producer?

213
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,934
I may not seem like it,

214
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,937
but I was once a promising student
of the film industry.

215
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,816
My boss finally noticed my talents.

216
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,861
They say that the sparrow near a school
sings the primer.

217
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,699
You've worked there for eight years,
so let's hope you learned something too.

218
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,284
Right, of course.

219
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,286
Wait. What did you just say?

220
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,746
Whatever.

221
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,541
If you don't get paid
at the end of this month too,

222
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,084
you should quit your trash job.

223
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,879
Mom, please. That would be disloyal of me.

224
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,716
Besides, I have a good feeling
about this next project.

225
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:31,139
Does that mean
we won't have to pay rent anymore?

226
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,723
The rent?

227
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,978
Don't you worry
because I'll buy this darn house.

228
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,522
That's so cool, Mom.

229
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,482
Up top!

230
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,609
THUMB FILM

231
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,200
This is odd.
I can't get in touch with him.

232
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,493
Maybe it's our cell reception.

233
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,165
Maybe he got lost.

234
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,419
It's true that our office
is hard to locate.

235
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,381
He's here!

236
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,068
-Goodness. Welcome.
-Hello.

237
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,821
All right then. Hye-jin,
escort them to the conference room.

238
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,573
-It's this way.
-We're--

239
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,577
Over here.

240
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,296
Here we go. You've got this.

241
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,385
-Faster.
-Go, go!

242
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,721
-Nice.
-All right.

243
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,057
Shoot!

244
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,436
-Go, go!
-Go, go!

245
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,563
-So young and innocent.
-Go, go!

246
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,365
He's not too bad.

247
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,247
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

248
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,249
-Please take this.
-You were awesome.

249
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,125
That was incredible.

250
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,752
School starts in 90 seconds.

251
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,380
Hurry up, everyone.

252
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,590
Gosh, you stink of sweat.

253
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,758
Get your butts inside!

254
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,635
RESPECT YOUR TEACHERS

255
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,970
Stop right there.

256
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,268
Article 13 Section One
of Hanbak Middle School's rule book.

257
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,436
Students without name tags

258
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,356
will receive penalty points
for bad conduct.

259
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,900
Aren't you aware of that fact?

260
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,319
-I'm not.
-Fine.

261
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,363
Then I'll give you a chance.

262
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,825
You have 30 seconds
to clip your name tag in the right place.

263
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,827
-I don't have one.
-You don't?

264
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,037
This is my first day
at this school, you see.

265
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,919
Did you really think
I'd fall for that palpable lie?

266
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,715
Follow me inside
and find out for yourself.

267
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,134
What an attitude...

268
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,554
How dare you talk back to a teacher?

269
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,930
Do you want more penalty points?

270
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,808
I think she's telling the truth.

271
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,189
Get your hands off me.

272
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,817
A new student is joining my class today.

273
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,944
I'm glad I got a smart one.

274
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,741
Are you sure she's one of yours?

275
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,534
I think so.

276
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,161
Your name is...

277
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,413
Noh Ha-nee, right?

278
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,124
That's right.

279
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,587
I'll take her with me then, Mr. Jang.

280
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,049
-Shall we?
-Sure.

281
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,301
Have a good day then.

282
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,640
Husband over Flowers,
the new movie of Thumb Film,

283
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,770
follows a woman
who's been single for 14 years

284
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,564
as she miraculously finds love.

285
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,985
The award-winning Director Kim Sang-ho

286
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,446
will showcase his style and vision.

287
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,615
That combined with

288
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:22,036
the fresh love story
will hopefully draw in the audience...

289
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,704
The...

290
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,499
audience.

291
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,006
The cost of production

292
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,346
will be 6.6 billion won.

293
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,516
With the costs
for marketing and advertising--

294
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,977
We estimate ten billion won in total.

295
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,522
Right.

296
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,481
How do you expect to

297
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,566
raise all that money?

298
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,117
We hope for you, the investor,
to invest in our movie.

299
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,707
That's a shame. It seems like
there's some kind of misunderstanding.

300
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,875
A misunderstanding?

301
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,007
Thank you.

302
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,301
"Nine Capital"?

303
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,514
Wait, a money lending company?

304
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,351
Why are you here at our studio though?

305
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,981
You boss at Thumb Film
borrowed 700 million won from us.

306
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,692
-What? 700 million?
-700 million won?

307
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,278
That's right, and just so you know,

308
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,573
the principal and interest combined
is 1.05 billion won.

309
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,033
1.05 billion won? Holy shit.

310
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,036
Hye-jin, call the boss.

311
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,956
-His phone is turned off.
-What?

312
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,334
As you can see, Mr. Wang is unreachable.

313
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,838
So you, Ms. Noh, must pay back his debt.

314
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,006
Me?

315
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,799
What? Why?

316
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,051
Why me? Why must I pay it back?

317
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,053
-I--
-Because you...

318
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,639
stood surety for him.

319
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,649
What is this?

320
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,735
What the hell is this?

321
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,361
JOINT SURETY AGREEMENT

322
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,744
You're no longer our bookkeeper.

323
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,205
You're now Noh Ae-jeong the producer.

324
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:35,127
Produce a movie of your own
and make a name for yourself.

325
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,922
No. No, don't!

326
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,757
Don't sign it.

327
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,760
Quit paying rents and buy your own house.

328
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,139
NOH AE-JEONG

329
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,271
That's it, Producer Noh.

330
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,113
JOINT SURETY AGREEMENT

331
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,991
Hold on, sir. Wait!

332
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,327
My boss wouldn't have done this to me.

333
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,998
I only thought I was signing off
an investment of 70 million won.

334
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:17,253
How can it go from 70 million
to over a billion won?

335
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,548
Sir, please. Please forgive me this once.

336
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,801
Ms. Noh!

337
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,930
Sir, wait. Please!

338
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,269
Choi Hyang-ja, born July 5, 1960.

339
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,396
A body scrub master.

340
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,482
She's your mother, am I right?

341
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,152
What the hell is this?

342
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,948
Noh Ha-nee, born February 15, 2007.

343
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,951
Transferred to Hanbak Middle School
due to personal reasons.

344
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,037
She's your daughter, am I right?

345
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,417
Are you serious right now?

346
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,419
You have two weeks to pay back the debt.

347
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,089
If you aren't able to pay by then,

348
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:07,261
unpleasant things
might happen to those around you.

349
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,179
Don't forget that.

350
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,280
Ms. Noh, are you all right?

351
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,788
Are you sure about that?

352
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,914
And you?

353
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,958
I made
the Statue of Liberated French Fries.

354
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:44,048
Kids are pretty much the same
whichever school they go to.

355
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,384
Hold on. Right, got it.

356
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,352
Bullseye.

357
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,562
-Did you see that?
-Nice!

358
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,315
-Nice one.
-Good shot.

359
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,487
Sorry about that, new girl.
I bet I startled you.

360
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,741
What should we try next?

361
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,934
Mr. Wang!

362
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,688
Ms. Noh, isn't this breaking and entering?

363
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,147
Where is the bastard?

364
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,525
-What on earth is this?
-Where is he?

365
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,652
Rat bastard.

366
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,654
Did he really run off?

367
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,656
-He was already sued.
-What?

368
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:52,991
Let me see.

369
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,119
Gosh, it stinks.

370
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,913
LIFE IS DO OR DIE

371
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,337
Ms. Noh, isn't this a contract?

372
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,172
PUBLICATION RIGHT OF LOVE IS NONEXISTENT

373
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,716
"Love Is Nonexistent"?

374
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,387
Jeez, this is really old.

375
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,097
The terms aren't even fair.

376
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:22,312
He left behind stupid trash, that bastard!

377
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,023
Tell me about it.
It must've been worthless

378
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,818
for it to have been stuck under the pot.

379
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,282
You fucking bastard.

380
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,829
I ought to...

381
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,332
Fuck...

382
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,209
You shitty little jackass!

383
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,346
Please calm down.

384
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,515
Gosh!

385
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,643
Really?

386
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,437
Hello?

387
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,775
Yes. Ha-nee?

388
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,986
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT

389
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,654
STUDENT NAME NOH HA-NEE

390
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,533
MOTHER NAME NOH AE-JEONG

391
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,163
Hello, I'm Noh Ha-nee's mother.

392
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,999
Where is the counseling office?

393
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,293
It's at the end of the hallway
on the second floor.

394
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,296
End of the hall, second floor?

395
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,464
Thank you.

396
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,926
Excuse me, Ms. Noh!

397
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,469
Ha-nee!

398
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,597
Ha-nee!

399
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,724
Ha-nee.

400
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:47,272
This is Ha-nee's mother.

401
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,652
Yes, I'm Ha-nee's mother.

402
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,239
Look.

403
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,785
This is what your daughter did
to my son's face.

404
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,119
I'm so upset.

405
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,331
I'm sorry.

406
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,666
I'm really sorry.

407
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,626
It's my fault.

408
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,128
-Ma'am, I'm sorry.
-Mom.

409
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,799
Come here. Come here and apologize.

410
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,801
-Quickly.
-I don't want her apology.

411
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,928
I want to hold
a School Violence Committee meeting.

412
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:20,973
Sir.

413
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,059
A School Violence Committee
meeting can hurt all the students.

414
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,143
Mr. Oh.

415
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,522
Are you playing dumb
because it's not your student

416
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,857
who got the nosebleed?

417
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,650
Mr. Jang, that's not--

418
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:36,446
Anyway, we'll see if the meeting
will hurt the kids or not when we hold--

419
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,535
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I apologize.

420
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,954
-Please forgive--
-Let go. What are you doing?

421
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,373
-I'm sorry.
-I don't need to hear it anymore.

422
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,500
Let's have men settle this.

423
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,003
Where is her dad?

424
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,631
I don't have a dad.

425
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,763
I have no such thing as a dad,

426
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,933
so if you have something to say,
just say it to me.

427
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,063
-Ha-nee.
-I knew it.

428
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,358
There was a reason why she was

429
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,736
-so ill-behaved.
-Honey, stop.

430
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,613
Ms. Noh.

431
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,366
Let me give you an advice
as a fellow parent.

432
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,370
Children from single-parent families
should be raised more strictly.

433
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,748
If you pity them and indulge them,

434
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:32,044
it shows that they have no dad.

435
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,715
Sir.

436
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,052
Don't you think
what you just said is unacceptable?

437
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,471
She...

438
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,391
has a dad.

439
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,272
I'm her dad and her mom.

440
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,945
My kid has never once

441
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,491
been raised with only half the love.

442
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,001
You can charge me for the hospital bill.

443
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,255
I'll fully compensate your son
for the pain he suffered.

444
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,090
But...

445
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,348
how will you compensate

446
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,850
for my child's heartache?

447
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,446
I'm sorry for all the commotion, Mr. Oh.

448
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,407
Excuse us. Let's go.

449
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,451
Ms. Noh.

450
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,913
-Ms. Noh.
-I'll see them off.

451
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,667
Please don't mind them.

452
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,299
Mom, I really didn't do anything wrong.

453
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,718
I didn't hit him. He first...

454
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,597
Mom?

455
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,809
-Mom, are you listening?
-Noh Ha-nee.

456
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,270
Transferred to Hanbak Middle School
due to personal reasons.

457
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,772
Let's go. We have to go.

458
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,816
-What's wrong? Where are we going?
-Let's go.

459
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,651
Mom, let go of my arm.

460
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,238
Mom, do you really think it was my fault?

461
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,865
Be quiet, Ha-nee.

462
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,494
Ha-nee, let's go home and talk, okay?

463
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,746
Let's go home.

464
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,875
Ha-nee! What are you doing?

465
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,626
Hey.

466
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,506
Why won't you listen to me?

467
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,633
Ha-nee.

468
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,138
Before you say sorry,
before you apologize,

469
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,390
shouldn't you listen to me first?

470
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,813
I asked you already.

471
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,484
I asked you not to get into trouble
on the first day of school.

472
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,445
Never mind. I don't want to hear it.

473
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,824
How long do I have to live
with my heart in my mouth because of you?

474
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,704
Whose fault is that?

475
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,042
What?

476
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,836
It's your fault!

477
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,964
If you hadn't given birth to me,

478
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,176
you and I didn't have to be treated
like shit!

479
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,182
This is useless!

480
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,436
No matter what I do,

481
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,731
the fact that I don't have a dad
doesn't change.

482
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,385
That kid, Han Chan-yeong

483
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,930
deserves a nosebleed.

484
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,642
He always bullies me.

485
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,020
Today Ha-nee taught him a lesson.

486
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,983
Nobody has ever stood up for me.

487
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,986
Ha-nee was the only one who helped me.

488
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,156
Ha-nee didn't do anything wrong.

489
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,517
How much did that CEO bastard
scam you for?

490
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,394
About ten?

491
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,527
It's ten billion won.

492
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,489
What a bastard.

493
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,580
I realized that you shouldn't call
something the worst so recklessly.

494
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,667
Because that might not be the worst.

495
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,466
Drink up.

496
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,847
I'm buying this for the most
miserable person on Earth today.

497
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,524
Sook-hee.

498
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,236
Why do bad things always happen
all at once?

499
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,655
I'm not sure.

500
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:56,284
Since they all came at once,
they'll probably leave all at once.

501
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,538
No.

502
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,540
They won't.

503
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,709
Because they didn't 14 years ago.

504
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,718
Would it have been different
if I hadn't met him then?

505
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,599
If you pity them and indulge them,

506
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,560
it shows that they have

507
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,311
no dad.

508
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,944
Bullocks. It doesn't at all.

509
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,988
I look perfect.

510
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,950
-Mom! I'm home.
-Yes.

511
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,077
Here.

512
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,790
-What? Did you drink?
-A little.

513
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,709
Eat this.

514
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,087
Where's Ha-nee? Is she in her room?

515
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,408
I'm her dad

516
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,660
and her mom.

517
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,715
Sir, wait!

518
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,510
Stop. Please wait.

519
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,178
I'm sorry.

520
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,304
Sir!

521
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,974
Thank you.

522
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,435
I'm so tired. Thank you.

523
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,691
-Thank you.
-I almost missed it.

524
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,028
Goodness.

525
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,198
I'm sorry.

526
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,743
Oh, no.

527
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,787
It's creased.

528
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,330
It must be something important.

529
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:51,292
Yes, I've lost days of sleep
to write this proposal.

530
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,669
What am I going to do?

531
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,296
Anyway, thank you.

532
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,219
Hello.

533
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,303
Hello.

534
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,098
You're Ha-nee's homeroom teacher, right?

535
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,308
Good to see you.

536
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,067
Sorry.

537
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,946
I'm sorry. That was my mistake.

538
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,532
I guess you still don't recognize me.

539
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,453
Pardon?

540
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,664
Long time no see, Ae-jeong.

541
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,620
Ae-jeong, open the window.

542
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,497
Open the window?

543
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,256
I missed you.

544
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,679
Don't worry about Ha-nee.
I'll take good care of her.

545
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,181
Okay.

546
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,434
Goodbye. Go on.

547
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,230
Ae-jeong! See you again.

548
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,731
I'll call you!

549
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:51,412
Why of all people is he Ha-nee's
homeroom teacher?

550
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,042
This is driving me nuts!

551
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,063
Yes, Ha-nee.

552
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,524
You look happy.

553
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,650
What?

554
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,236
Well...

555
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,696
Here.

556
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,907
Thank you for trusting me yesterday.

557
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,580
Goodbye.

558
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,249
Ha-nee.

559
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,757
If you're having a hard time,

560
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,759
tell me, all right?

561
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,265
Thanks for this.

562
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,391
Okay.

563
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,188
Thank you.

564
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,454
HUSBAND OVER FLOWERS

565
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,461
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry.

566
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,434
Hello, sir.

567
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,811
I'm Producer Noh Ae-jeong of Thumb Film.

568
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,522
I requested an investment meeting
last time.

569
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,399
I heard Thumb Film went bankrupt.

570
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,776
No, it didn't.

571
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,987
The company isn't in a good situation,
but we're working on something.

572
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,865
Once you read it, you'll see that
the script is very solid.

573
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,534
I heard another company
was working on this.

574
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,747
No, our company signed a contract
a long time ago.

575
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,959
No, this was sold to a different company.

576
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:07,006
Let me tell you this so you don't go to
another company and get humiliated.

577
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,468
There's no company that would invest
in Thumb Films in this industry.

578
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,428
Sir.

579
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,764
This is Producer Noh Ae-jeong
of Thumb Film.

580
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,935
Ms. Noh, are you really doing this?

581
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:23,314
Sir, I heard some strange news.

582
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,735
There's a ridiculous rumor going around
that you're working with another company.

583
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,613
People in this industry spread gossip
so recklessly, don't they?

584
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:31,656
I'm sorry, Producer Noh.

585
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,449
I heard Mr. Wang fled.

586
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,952
He breached the contract first.

587
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,579
-What?
-It worked out for the better.

588
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,750
Thumb Film didn't even have
the ability to produce my work anyway.

589
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:46,963
I'm still here.

590
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,424
Sign a contract with me again.

591
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:50,967
You know me.

592
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,221
Since I first met you,
I've been working really hard.

593
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,516
I'll do my best to make your work

594
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,560
-see the light--
-You should give up.

595
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,103
Please, sir.

596
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,402
Producer Noh.

597
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,654
This is your first film, right?

598
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,575
Let's be frank. Can you bring in the money

599
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,327
and hire all the actors I want
for this film?

600
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:22,999
Well...

601
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,418
I know you've been working really hard
for several months,

602
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,045
but you don't have the ability

603
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,504
to produce my work.

604
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,439
THUMB FILM

605
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,777
SUMMER IN LOVE

606
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,872
CEO of Thumb Film.

607
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,378
CEO WANG SEONG GYU

608
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,466
Ms. Noh.

609
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,219
Did something happen?

610
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,222
No, nothing.

611
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,851
Let's sell whatever we can here.

612
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,523
I'll pay your salary with that money.

613
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,610
But you need the money more than I do.

614
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,154
I'm okay.

615
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,784
For the time being,

616
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,622
I decided to focus on
what to do with the bastard.

617
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,165
Pardon?

618
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,417
Just you wait.

619
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,171
I'll grab his neck and throw him down
on asphalt.

620
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,340
I'll punch his face

621
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,969
and beat him to a pulp
until all his teeth fall out.

622
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,971
Are you okay?

623
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,264
Goodness.

624
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,640
-It's bleeding.
-Goodness.

625
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,559
Gosh.

626
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,727
Throw this out.

627
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:07,937
Okay.

628
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,151
Goodness.

629
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,195
This is a really old
handwritten manuscript.

630
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,532
I don't care if it's handwritten or not.

631
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,534
Burn it all!

632
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,453
Okay.

633
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,587
But...

634
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,213
this was written by

635
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,674
the author Cheon Eok-man.

636
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,438
Cheon Eok-man.

637
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,567
-This is really old.
-He left behind stupid trash!

638
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,363
LOVE IS NONEXISTENT

639
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,324
"Love Is Nonexistent."

640
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,200
What?

641
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,160
What's this?

642
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,745
Hye-jin.

643
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,372
-A wet wipe
-A wet wipe.

644
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,540
A wet wipe.

645
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,318
Easy now.

646
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,404
Cheon Eok...

647
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,116
CHEON EOK-MAN

648
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,079
No way. This copyright contract...

649
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,749
It's signed by the best-selling author,
Cheon Eok-man!

650
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,709
Goodness!

651
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,630
-We did it! We're saved!
-Yes!

652
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,257
We did it!

653
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,680
This place is unbelievable.

654
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,891
He must be loaded
since he owns a loan company.

655
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:09,934
There's a grass lawn!

656
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,062
The house is beautiful.

657
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,730
It's really big.

658
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,954
Ms. Noh.

659
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,122
Yes?

660
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,257
Run!

661
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,396
Stay back!

662
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:57,940
Get back!

663
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,737
Get back!

664
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,158
Go away!

665
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,477
I was told

666
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,104
that you wanted to tell me something.

667
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:39,899
Well...

668
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,443
Actually...

669
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,819
Please have a seat.

670
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,535
Let's go.

671
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,082
Well, actually...

672
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,960
I would like to

673
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,463
do business with you.

674
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,592
Business?

675
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,145
This is the copyright contract
of Writer Cheon Eok-man,

676
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:21,482
the number one author
that investors want to invest in in 2020.

677
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,326
If I make a movie with that,
I can attract over ten million viewers,

678
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,704
and repay the loan of one billion won
in a lump sum with the proceeds.

679
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,834
I'm not sure.

680
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,086
Who would invest in a film company

681
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,755
that was abandoned by its CEO?

682
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,970
There's no company that would invest
in Thumb Films in this industry.

683
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,764
You don't have the ability
to produce my work.

684
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,558
Even if you have the copyright,

685
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,977
who would trust you

686
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,812
and make an investment?

687
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,190
I believe we're both busy.

688
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,484
So you better leave.

689
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,281
Then

690
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,496
why don't you make that investment?

691
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,040
Ms. Noh.

692
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,783
I...

693
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,786
only invest in people I can trust.

694
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,040
If it's worth money,

695
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,917
I trust people

696
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,794
and invest as much as I want.

697
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,464
I would even risk my life.

698
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,090
If you give me a chance,

699
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,636
I'll prove that I, Noh Ae-jeong,

700
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,306
am capable as a producer.

701
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,309
Please stop.

702
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:27,983
Do you mean that you are willing
to risk your life

703
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,194
for this investment?

704
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,739
I'm confident.

705
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,574
Because my life

706
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,369
is in the hands of my family.

707
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,671
Fine. I'll give you an opportunity.

708
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,839
-An--
-An--

709
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,258
-An opportunity?
-An opportunity?

710
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,217
An opportunity?

711
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,222
First, I need someone
to write the scenario.

712
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,476
Cheon Eok-man, the original author,
should do it.

713
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,853
-What?
-What?

714
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,230
Cheon Eok-man?

715
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,899
And as for the actor...

716
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,360
ACTOR RYU JIN DEBUTS IN HOLLYWOOD?

717
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,654
How about Ryu Jin?

718
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,658
You see, I'm a fan of his.

719
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,161
Ryu Jin?

720
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,248
Are you talking about that celebrity
who'll be debuting in Hollywood?

721
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,751
Does it have to be him?

722
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,628
There are many actors in Korea.

723
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,464
Like I said, Ryu Jin will be the actor,
and Cheon Eok-man, the writer.

724
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,301
If you succeed,
not only will I settle your debt,

725
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,304
but I'll also invest in the movie myself.

726
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,307
Ten billion won.

727
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,435
Ten billion won?

728
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,147
LETTER OF INTENT

729
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,732
You have eight days.

730
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,650
If you fail to keep your promise,

731
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,777
you should be prepared.

732
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:27,353
Tell him never to look for me again

733
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:31,857
and that the next time I see him,

734
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,322
I'll have his head.

735
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,241
-Over here.
-Pose for the camera.

736
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,410
-This way.
-Please look here.

737
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,120
-Hello.
-This way, please.

738
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,872
Okay, thank you.

739
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:47,956
Please pose.

740
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,250
-Please look this way.
-Please strike a pose.

741
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,794
Okay, thank you.

742
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,337
-Hey, Hye-jin.
-Ms. Noh.

743
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,297
I've almost arrived at Mr. Cheon's house.

744
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,132
How's it going over there?

745
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,802
It doesn't look easy,

746
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,178
but I'll have to make it work.

747
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,222
You said you guys knew each other.

748
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,808
I'm sure he won't ignore you.

749
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,518
Right.

750
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,397
We did have a special relationship.

751
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,523
Please pose for the camera.

752
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,191
Okay, thank you.

753
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,275
Jin.

754
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,985
Jin.

755
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,071
Well...

756
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,365
Let's kiss.

757
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,879
HELLO, DAN-BI
IN THEATRES APRIL 20

758
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,965
Not too long ago,
you were invited to Hollywood

759
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,800
and came back to Korea this morning.

760
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,052
Have you brought back some good news?

761
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,346
I'm just doing my best at all times.

762
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,644
Did you meet with Director James Caramel?

763
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:56,108
He's a big fan of Korean cuisine.

764
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:59,194
Does this mean
you're set to debut in Hollywood?

765
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:03,615
I think around next week, I'll be with
James under the Californian sun

766
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,784
with a glass of mojito in my hand.

767
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,578
Who's the co-star?

768
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,912
No comments on that.

769
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,957
Since many people
have been waiting for me,

770
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,585
I'll make sure to hold
a press conference soon.

771
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,753
I look forward to today's movie,

772
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,298
and I hope many of you will check it out.
Thank you.

773
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,975
Jin!

774
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,144
Jin!

775
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,645
Jin!

776
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,022
Jin!

777
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,650
Jin, don't go to Hollywood. Stay with me.

778
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,027
Wait!

779
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,529
-Wait a minute!
-Jin!

780
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,198
-Move aside! No photos!
-Jin!

781
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,867
Jin! Hold on!

782
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,329
RYU JIN'S DIEHARD FAN BARGES IN
DURING A MOVIE PREVIEW

783
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,960
So you couldn't meet him?

784
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,171
I'm going to try again.

785
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,757
I'm going to visit his agency

786
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,425
or even his house.

787
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,887
Good. You said you guys had
a special relationship.

788
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,639
You will find another opportunity.

789
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,683
Special?

790
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,101
Yes.

791
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,604
We were almost special.

792
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:21,193
-Noh Ae-jeong!
-Noh Ae-jeong!

793
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,030
-Noh Ae-jeong!
-Noh Ae-jeong!

794
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,866
-No.
-Just drink it!

795
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,034
You said you would!

796
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,453
No. Just give me the penalty.

797
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,748
-Writing her name with her butt!
-No!

798
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,793
Seeing how much alcohol is left,

799
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,420
she should kiss someone to make up for it.

800
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,130
You're right!

801
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,507
No way!

802
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,760
-Lucky you.
-Come on.

803
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,554
-With whom?
-Me, of course.

804
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,473
No, not you.

805
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:52,933
I...

806
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,228
will pick

807
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,771
whom to kiss!

808
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,357
-What?
-Come on.

809
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,486
Here I go.

810
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,862
-All right, let's go.
-Ae-jeong.

811
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,948
-Let's go.
-Ae-jeong.

812
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,825
-Let's hurry.
-Wait up!

813
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,410
-Hey!
-Wait!

814
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,494
I'm curious to find out.

815
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,204
Wait for me!

816
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,289
Open up!

817
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,628
Let's go.

818
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,880
-Hurry up.
-Hey!

819
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,257
-What?
-Look at her!

820
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,552
Jin.

821
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:30,804
Jin.

822
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,140
Well...

823
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,475
You see...

824
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:41,982
So...

825
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,445
Let's kiss.

826
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,878
No!

827
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,311
What is that?

828
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,316
That's disgusting!

829
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,904
Ae-jeong, what about we go somewhere else?

830
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:33,700
My shoes.

831
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,037
My shoes!

832
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,163
My shoes!

833
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,083
My shoes...

834
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,545
My shoes!

835
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,674
Hey!

836
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,347
What?

837
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,142
We're no match for Hollywood.

838
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,187
Don't be ridiculous.

839
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,775
We have the almighty Cheon Eok-man.

840
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,402
I'm not sure about that.

841
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,320
I can't seem to reach him.

842
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,116
What? You can't reach him?

843
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:20,539
Jin!

844
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,333
Jin!

845
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:28,171
Jin! I got some ointment. Let me see.

846
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,507
Oh, come on. I'm fine.

847
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,009
Not at all.

848
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,344
She should've collapsed
on top of me instead.

849
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,637
What if the wound scars?

850
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,226
Hey.

851
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,353
I'm really fine.

852
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,734
Rather, I'm happy.

853
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:54,364
I witnessed a fan who loved me so much
that she'd pounce on me.

854
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,201
Jin.

855
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:02,164
Oftentimes, I'm so proud
to be your manager. No.

856
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,916
I'm so proud to be your close friend.

857
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,505
It doesn't matter how much
this world changes.

858
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,675
Once a brother, always a brother.

859
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,886
Got that?

860
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,554
Jin!

861
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,391
How on earth did a fan
barge at him like that?

862
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,018
How could you let Jin fall down?

863
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,394
I'm sorry, ma'am.

864
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,438
Ms. Song.

865
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,068
I'm sorry I got worked up.

866
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,362
I was worried that you were badly injured.

867
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:39,076
Anyway, good work on the audition
and the film preview.

868
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,369
While we wait for James Caramel
to call back,

869
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,830
how about we have a party
to celebrate your return?

870
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,460
-I've reserved a place.
-You can have the party without me.

871
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,922
I have a previous engagement.

872
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,173
With whom?

873
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,467
No one told me about this.

874
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,263
With Kwae-nam.

875
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,935
Let's go grab a drink,

876
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,353
Kwae-nam.

877
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,397
Okay.

878
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,193
I should take the ointment.

879
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,240
Jin.

880
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,577
THIS IS NOH AE-JEONG FROM THUMB FILM

881
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,163
HELLO, MR. CHEON EOK-MAN

882
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,543
I AM WRITING TO YOU BECAUSE

883
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,471
WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOVIE
WITH A SCRIPT YOU WROTE

884
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,186
SINCERELY, NOH AE-JEONG FROM THUMB FILM

885
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,108
Please.

886
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,819
I beg you, Mr. Cheon.

887
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:00,657
Please take a look at my email.

888
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:04,786
My future is in your hands.

889
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:05,871
Please.

890
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,335
To all the gods out there,

891
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:15,881
please help me out this once. Please.

892
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,800
YOUR MAIL HAS BEEN SENT

893
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,810
ANNUAL SPRING LITERARY CONTEST

894
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:35,150
How great is he
that everyone loves him so much?

895
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,281
Let's take a look.

896
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,537
"Love Is Nonexistent."

897
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,545
SHE VANISHED. SHE LEFT ME OUT OF THE BLUE

898
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,174
"When it was announced that
the wish of the winner will be granted,

899
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,594
I swung the sword with all my might

900
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,305
with the thought that I could finally
tell her how I felt."

901
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,608
"As I held her hand for the first time

902
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:23,990
and as our eyes met,
I felt as if I was drifting away."

903
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,898
Do not hold the sword in your left hand.

904
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,818
Your left hand is close to your heart,

905
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,487
so it will only endanger you
when you wield the sword.

906
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:04,447
So that was why.

907
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,534
That was why

908
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,537
my sword swayed in front of you.

909
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,791
"Even until then, I had no idea

910
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,878
that the woman I loved wanted to kill me."

911
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,173
No way.

912
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,844
Does that mean she betrayed him?

913
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,682
It's a historical piece,

914
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,893
and it's also melodramatic
and action-packed.

915
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,479
This really is something.

916
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:12,599
THIS IS CHEON EOK-MAN.
IF YOU'RE FREE, I'D LIKE TO MEET YOU

917
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,061
AT MARAGON CITY HOTEL'S COFFEE SHOP
AT 1 P.M. TODAY.

918
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:17,937
He replied.

919
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,400
Mom!

920
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:25,737
-Mom!
-My goodness, what's wrong?

921
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,156
Mom, Cheon Eok-man replied back.

922
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,242
He replied!

923
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,245
Cheon Eok-man!

924
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,166
Grandma, what's wrong with her?

925
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,836
-I have no idea.
-Cheon Eok-man!

926
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,338
Who is Cheon Eok-man?

927
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,798
Cheon Eok-man!

928
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,551
He wanted to see me immediately.

929
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,970
He wrote it before he became famous,
so it's special to him.

930
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:54,724
No way! I think we've hit the jackpot!

931
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,142
Calm down and be patient.

932
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,894
I'm going to persuade him no matter what.

933
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,312
-Okay!
-Bye.

934
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,700
Hello?

935
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,203
Yes, I'm on the 26th floor.

936
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,329
Hello?

937
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,415
Yes.

938
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,208
Okay.

939
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,795
WRITER CHEON EOK-MAN

940
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,538
Is this Producer Noh Ae-jeong?

941
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:02,959
What?

942
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,627
Hello?

943
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,275
A DIEHARD FAN BARGES IN

944
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,465
THINKING OF YOU WAS WHAT I DID ALL MY LIFE

945
01:06:55,845 --> 01:07:00,350
TO AE-JEONG

946
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,407
Hello.

947
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,201
I'm Cheon Eok-man.

948
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:48,181
WAS IT LOVE?

949
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:51,192
You used to know the writer Cheon Eok-man?

950
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:54,821
How does it feel to meet me again
in 14 years?

951
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:59,158
Why do I need that sick bastard's help?

952
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,035
So you've failed your mission.

953
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,495
No!

954
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:03,538
You've changed a lot.

955
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,208
How could I forget you, Ae-jeong?

956
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,460
I waited and waited for her back then.

957
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:13,047
I've missed you a lot.

958
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:17,510
Will the sun ever shine
for someone like me?

959
01:08:20,005 --> 01:08:21,723
